I bought my first HP12C in about 1984 or so, and it served me faithfully until 2002 when I lost it while travelling.  I searched for another one to replace it, but found one difficult to come by in my area.  So, I decided to buy up and purchased an HP 49G.  What a mistake!  I know that many people view the HP 49G (now 49G+) as the flagship of the HP line, but for me that was a disaster.The 49G may be powerful, but using it is extremely counterintuitive...and the manual was sketchy at best.  The 12C, on the other hand, does what I need in a way that makes good sense to me.If you are looking for a solid, reliable calculator, the HP12C may be for you.  It's programmable.  It does basic statistics well, and many business applications too.  The manual makes sense; you will be up and running in short order.I'm ready to set my 49G aside and move back to my old friend.  I didn't even have to replace the batteries in well over a decade of use!HP 12C, I'm coming home!WHY THIS BELATED REVIEW? I feel very obliged to share my views about this old workhorse, the HP12C GOLD at its 25th anniversary and my 1Oth year as a satisfied ower user and fan. Especially after sharing my frank views on Amazon about two of its three successors on Amazon.com, burying the HP12c Platinum (2004 1st release, HP12cP) and praising the HP12c Platiunum Anniversary Edition (2006 3rd release, HP12cPAE or HP12cPA).To the majority of HP 12c calculator owners and fans, including the non-techkie nerd like myself, the name Hewlett-Packard To the majority of HP 12c calculator owners and fans. The brandname of Hewlett-Packard is synonymous with the highest quality and best range offered in handheld electronic business financial calculators before the first generation of personal computers hits the desktops of business users.To date (December 2007), the bearer of this "gold" standard is none other than the HP12C HP's "golden boy" in its calculator business segment.The HP12C now a matured product, is the only continuing HP handheld surviving calculator product since '81 and probably the longest selling electronic calculator ever. According to HP almost 15 million HP 12Cs, cPs was sold since ,it is probably the best selling HP (and RPN) calculator ever.As a proven product, the HP12C "gold" works from day 1, with its form factor and sofware remaining unchanged and has not been dethroned by rivals and even its HP successors which had come and go.Even with PC software versions being sold, the 12C remains the truly indispensable "portable" finance-business heldheld computer for its owners, professionals and students alike. This handy companion powers up immediately and is faster than any portable personal computers to jump right into the action.The HP12C is a serious product and the ultimate time tested solution, field tested proven by its users and survived all its rival products, the workhorse moves on.Anyone in charge of this HP line should always bear in mind that the continued production run of the HP 12c is a testimony of HP's quality and standard expected by its customers.Don't just listen to a HP12C fan here, I own and am using three out of 4 models of the HP 12C series, and it is amusing and somewhat disappointing to observe that it had taken HP at least four years and two major upgrades of the HP 12c Platinium, in its futile attempt to "fix & retire" the HP12C with three successors in the form of HP12cPlatinum since 2004.It would seems especially frustrating on the part of HP, to realize after all the effort spent on remaking the HP12cPlatinum models that it would not outdone its siblings the HP10bII and HP17bII+ series to seriously challenge the HP12C Gold.  However, by their own rights the HP10Bs and HP17Bs, and the HP12cPlatinum may find their rightful place in the HP financial calculator line, differentiating the HP12C GOLD in terms of price and functions.IMHO, this had happened because the following golden rules were infringed by HP...GOLDEN RULE I - A PRODUCT WHICH STILL SELLS ITSELF IS NEVER OBSOLETE.GOLDEN RULE II - IF IT AREN'T BROKEN, DON't FIX IT ! "The gold rule of thumb should always be guarded as gospel by the HP heldheld calculator product team. Based on the same reasoning, the HP12C's built quality and product standard is paramount to its users.GOLDEN RULE III - ALWAYS LISTEN TO YOUR CUSTOMERS! If in doubt, see rules I & II.GOLDEN RULE IV - ONLY OUTSOURCE THE MANUFACTURING OF YOUR PRODUCT TO SOMEONE WHO COULD BETTER YOUR OWN PRODUCT QUALITY. If in doubt ask IBM about Lenovo.GOLDEN RULE V - THE BENCHMARKING INDUSTRY STANDARD FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE IS THE HP12C. Just in case, if HP does not know or is not listening to its customers.GOLDEN RULE VI - DO NOT DISCONTINUE THE ICONIC HP12C GOLD. HP needs no reminder that the customer is always right. Please let your customer, the ultimate market force decide if the HP12C should ever be retired.As an ardent fan of HP12C and line of financial business & scientific calculators, I am of the view that the day when HP discontinue the HP12C would be the day it exit this business segment. I speculate this would happen when the HP brandname disappears from the 12C just like after IBM name had disappeared from ThinkPads and ThinkCentres.Since the price of GOLD is on the rise, it is indeed puzzling to fans of the HP12C, why HP did not release a genuine HP12C gold 25th anniversary model for the fans to mark the occasion, if replacing the discontinuing the HP12C GOLD is the intention READ ALL GOLDEN RULES above.To be fair, the silver HP12c Platinum Anniversary is very nice and has spotted the "retro" silver look of the HP 11C, however, it is still not the GOLD standard. With HP missing this golden opportunity to mark the occasion, I would love to see and own a HP 12C engraved with 50th Anniversary logo, reckon that this would be the ultimate testimony for the HP12C and a milestone for its fans.Looking forward, a GOLD 50th anniversary HP12C Anniversary model would be very nice for the fans.For HP, this is a lucrative business proposition. By now, they would have realized that if they have any of its products which could hit a 50th year home run  in 2031, it would not be from its other product line-it would be this original HP12C GOLD standard bearer. So please treat the old workhorse with the upmost respect!I have an HP 48GX that has been kicking for more than twenty years and an HP 11 that is more than 25 years old and still flawless.  I have had this 12C for about 18 months and the number 5 key is already giving me trouble (have to press hard for it to register).  No drops, no abuse.  The overall feel of this new HP is cheaper plastic.  The keys feel hollow and light.  The available functions are great.  This is a classic calculator.  But the functions are no good if the keys stop working...I've started doing more finance stuff recently and went looking for a good time-value-of-money calculator. I was pleasantly surprised to find the HP12C was still available. I've been using HP calculators for decades (HP-45, HP-15 and now an HP-32SII) because of their great feel and long-lasting quality. However, it's also true that the HP12C is probably the last relic of the great HP calculator legacy. It has 'Made In China' stamped on the rear, but the keyboard feel seems much like my dear departed 15C. Hopefully it will have the same long-term durability.Why do I recommend this calculator?*) RPN. In my world, the purpose of a calculator is to solve fairly straightforward math exercises quickly. If you're a college student and need speed and pictures and parenthesis, buy a graphing calculator. If you're solving Black-Scholl's option equations, fire up Excel or something on your desktop computer. But for straightforward punch-it-in calculator work, nothing beats RPN entry.*) Fit and Finish. The keys have good tactile feedback. The display blinks on every entry. You just *know* you've entered the data correctly. The purpose of a calculator is quick, accurate answers at your fingertips. If you don't care about this, don't waste money on this calculator (or any high-end TI or Casio). Buy a $5 Walmart calculator.*) Straightforward financial calculations. Sure, I could write a program for my HP 32SII to do financial calculations. But why, when I can just key in the data directly to the HP12C, push dedicated financial keys, and get immediate answers. This calculator has most of the financial functions you need in a calculator (amortization, depreciation, NPV, date functions, etc.) along with the basic complement of standard calculator functions (ln, mean, standard deviation, factorial, etc). The complexity level is about right for a calculator. It doesn't take a computer science degree to operate it like the graphing calculators require, and it's far more capable than the $5 Walmart brands.*) Speed. I see reviews complaining that this calculator is slow when doing things like IRR computations. They're right. So what? If your IRR computation is that complicated, use a spreadsheet. If you're a college student taking exams, you're better off with a graphing calculator anyway. For 99% of the things the rest of us do with a calculator the 12C is more than fast enough, and the price of speed is power consumption. My 32SII is going on 10 years without a battery replacement, and I trust the 12C will have the same thrifty ways. It's a pain to need a quick answer, reach for the calculator, and then find the batteries are exhausted. This was a regular occurence when I owned TI and Casio brands. I've never had this problem with the HPs I've owned.It also has some programming capabilities which some may find useful. Personally, I haven't used the programming mode in a calculator for many years. Almost invariably I find it easier to just pull up a spreadsheet or write some code.I suspect the under-30 crowd will find this calculator--maybe the whole calculator premise--feels 'dated', and in a way they're right. However, if you're one of those who, like me, use these tools every day and always want one nearby, I think you'll like this calculator. For fit, finish, and a pleasant balance of performance with simplicity it seems to be on par with my earlier HP calculators. (Time will tell, I suppose, whether or not it has the same durability.) What is certain is that in the age of cellphones, PDAs and computers the era of high-quality long-lasting purpose-built calculators is going the way of the Dodo bird.For simple calculations and discounted cash flows, this one is still the best.  I used this in my graduate business program, and for years as a practicing CPA and financial executive.  Of course for complex cash flows you will want to use an Excel spreadsheet; but for quick cash flow calculations the HP12C really is the tool you want.Personally I find Reverse Polish Notation (&#34;RPN&#34;), which is what this calculator uses, to be easy and intuitive.  Many do; some don't.  RPN takes the place of brackets in an arithmetical expression and is easy to learn.The hardware on this calculator is superb.  One of these lasted me decades.  It got lost in an office move, so I am purchasing another.  RJB.While I don't have an MBA, it's hard to believe that a calculator I learned how to use in 1987 during undergraduate business courses is still the standard for the quick calculating financial world. Any finance professional over 30 will know how to use this, and in a pinch, you might need to know how to use it. I know the TI-8x series has financial functions and the graphic capabilities may make those calculators worthwhile. But for most financial pros, if it can't be done on an HP12C, then you probably need a computer.The RPN system isn't hard to learn (at a basic level it works similar to an adding machine), and the functions on this calculator take input and spit out output in a way similar to Excel (i.e. negative numbers for payments and positive for future value, etc.). I found mine the other day after not using it for a while and immediately used it for a discounted cash flow quick analysis I was later planning to do in Excel. It told me the on-the-fly answer I needed.I've had an HP 12C ever since they were first available, roughly twenty years ago.  I'm just in the process of buying another one, as my original one is finally and completely dead.If you're in any business and have anything to do with money (outside of being a cashier), this calculator is essential.  It includes almost every financial function that you need, and quite a few that you probably don't.  Any problem involving the time value of money or finance is a snap with this mini-machine.The only potential problem that I can see for a new user is the RPN format (By the way, RPN stands for Reverse Polish Notation.  It was invented by a Polish mathematician, Jan Lukasiewicz for symbolic logic.)  RPN is different from the traditional method on entering equations into a calculator, but is easy to learn and use...in fact, once you get used to it, the traditional way seems very clumsy.  For die-hards, the HP 12C Platinum Edition includes both traditional and RPN entry methods and is the one that should be purchased.Bought this for my boss because he lost his.  He loves this calculator & would not be caught without it.  It really helps him with his day to day work & he is the CEO of my company.  If the CEO swears by them then they must be a great little calculator.This is a well-designed, simple calculator that handles typical four-function math. Large, easy to read display that includes a comma to help ensure long strings are easier to read. The buttons are slightly sculpted which helps ensure you don't hit more than one at a time, and are nicely spaced. The display angles up and is legible in even somewhat dim lighting.Seems well-built - better than I expected given the price. Excellent choice if you're looking for a small desktop or hand-held calculator.My only complaint is that you can't clear the memory unless you display it. That seems to be the way with all calculators today. A shame -- I have a very old one that allows you to clear memory without displaying the number (e.g., has separate buttons for clear memory and display memory). That comes in handy at times.I love this calculator, big numbers and calculate excellent so easy to use and make my life so much easier.I've had mine for 4 years now and use it almost daily.  Never had any problems with it even after a few drops to the carpeted floor.  Large easy to read keys with a nice feel, not too hard - not too soft.  Large easy to read display.  All in all, good calculator for everyday basic functions.If you need a calculator that prints, this is not the calculator for you. However, if you need a handy sized, easy to read, solar calculator...this is a good one. It does everything that I want a calculator to do at work. It can figure %. I never use these features, but it can figure tax rates and has memory (mrc, m-, m+). The buttons are big enough. I would buy this model again.A great, basic calculator that does exactly what I need it to. It is a bit bigger than I'd like, but I've become used to it. I actually kind of like the bigger buttons now. I also like that it has a no-slide bottom (i.e., it stays in place when I am punching numbers at the table). Overall, a great purchase!Texas Instruments makes an excellent, relatively basic calculator with all the functions I need. The unit is sturdy; this is well made.In addition to solid construction, there are quite a few calculator functions that should suffice unless you need a scientific calculator or another more advanced model. The keys are good sized; and this makes using them to calculate things very easy. You can expect this product to reliably add, subtract, multiply and divide numbers; and you get square root, percentage, a change sign key (to change from a negative number to a positive number), and three memory function keys as well. Great! I also like that the display uses commas when necessary.There are three more function keys at the top of the buttons that read "(rate, tax+, tax-);" they are for calculating tax rates.Although this is a solar powered calculator (you can also use it under a light), it can be used with batteries as an option. There is a battery compartment on the back of the calculator but rest assured you don't need to use it; solar power or using this on a desk with a lamp will make a battery unnecessary.Overall, this is an excellent little calculator without the bells and whistles I just don't need. I highly recommend this item.This review is for the SECOND version of this calculator, the slightly-larger, grey, BLACK and white model, with a rounded "mound" housing the keypad.  I had actually ordered the older model -- the light-grey model, with the blue and white keys, slightly smaller, which I had had previously, but sadly lost.  I had considered returning this newer model, but finally decided against it, as it is now listed as being discontinued by the manufacturer, so -- if I returned the newer one I did get, I very well might have gotten the same model back..........I was, at first, extremely disappointed in the newer model.  (Why both the newer model and the older model -- which look COMPLETELY DIFFERENT -- have the VERY SAME MODEL NUMBER is completely beyond me.  I mean, people who work at Texas Instruments are supposed to be very intelligent and know what they are doing....but why they decided to give to truly different calculators the same model number is something I don't think I'll ever understand.  I mean...what kind of "genuis" makes this very simple mistake?  (one who wants to fool online and catalogue buyers, who have to trust that the packers will pack the right model, perhaps>)That said, this NEWER model -- though larger and more-than-slightly bulkier than the older one -- does have a few advantages....I think.I don't remember the older model having a "tax+" or "tax-" or "rate" key, nor do I remember it having a battery backup, as the newer model does.This newer model has a nice little compartment for the battery, which need only be opened with a single screw.  So, the entire back of the calculator need not be taken off -- with the slight dangers, therein, of getting dust into the machine, or disturbing the delicate circuitry, in the half a minute or so, that it takes to change the battery.  With a neat little separate oompartment for the battery changing, the rest of the back of the machine need not be disturbed at all!This is all the more important, as more and more calculators, sadly, are made with "no user-replaceable batteries" enclosed, (no -- one is instructed, in these other, still newer calculators, to take them to the nearest authorized repair shop, of the designated manufacturer -- and have them replaced there, like wrist-watch batteries!  First wrist-watches, now calculators!  Talk about planned obsolence!  (Buy even this newer model 1795SV, and keep it close!)Although the newer model 1795sv has a "wrap-around, windshield" numberical display, (instead of what is to me, the far more esthetically pleasing and clearer, "picture-frame" numberical display, found in the older model 1795sv), the numbers still are well-spaced and clear to view.  It also has the nice, l a r g e numberic display, which is not only on this newer model 1795SV, but also on the older model 1795SV.....and also on the belated, dearly loved, and sadly lost original Texas Instrument "1795" model, (no "sv"), which I once had, and enjoyed more than both of the "1795sv" models put together!  (It was small, handy, and a beautiful medium-bone-yellow in colour.  It also seemed to stay on FOREVER -- pr at least an hour or so, if I remember correctly.  Oh, that Texas Instruments would bring THAT model back, sigh!)Well, this NEW m0del 1795SV -- though NOT the older, handier model 1795SV, nor the original model 1795 -- still has many good points, most of which are delineated above.  It is also a desk-top model which can be carried in a pocket-book, if necessary -- and also in a briefcase, but not in a wallet.  It is bigger than the two previous models in the Texas Instrument 1795 line...but does have that priceless customer-replacable battery chamber.  Although I do prefer the previous two models, this newer one, now available, is not a bad little calculator, all things considered.But I would still welcome, (greatly!), the return of the original 1795 model, and/or the original 1795sv.This is a well built calculator that has large keys for folks with large fingers. I would recommend if you have larger hands. Ended up purchasing several for my company due to their popularity. Best large keyed calculator under $15.Texas Instruments Solar Calculater. This is a neat calculator and soent take up a ton of space on your desk. The numbers are large enough to see. And has never given me a false answer or calculation like other ones I have had.It has a solart cell so you do not have to be concerned with battery failure.  As your desl lamp or outside window light will keep it charged for you. Large led numbers are easy to read if your eye sight is not what it used to be.Purchased here on Amazon.com Where the whole World. Shops for Value.I didn't take math my senior year of high school and didn't know where my calculator was when I started college.  I bought this one because it was cheap, compared to the TI 83 that I wanted.  I used it for 2 years before it was damaged (my fault, not a product defect).I bought a cheap calculator to replace it and have been very disappointed. I plan on getting another calculator like these before my statistics class next semester.This is a good calculator, does what it is supposed to, great color, easy to take on the road when I travel.Amazon is totally my school supply go to place. They may not have the colors I want, but they ALWAYS have the price! 3rd calculator I've ordered here. Just like what you buy at the store (and usually less expensive)This calculator does the job for what I need. No batteries needed and it is solar powered. Only problem I have is the cover case. It is not slide in / slide out cover cases like most calculators. It is more of a snap it on / snap it off. Other than that it does help protect it from dust and getting the screen scratched.Outside of being able to attach this to your car's rim and use it as a tire, this calculator does about everything.  And, for a reasonable price!  This is the required calculator for the 6th grade here in Ohio, but I originally purchased mine for an advanced chemistry class for a top 10 university course 18 years ago.  It's still the one I grab every time I need a calculator - it performs all the scientific notation that I need, and doesn't become cumbersome like the TI-83.  I've used this for everything from calculus, microbiology, biochemistry to advanced chemistry and it's worked like a dream.  For the price, it just cannot be beat and durability, well that speaks for itself.  Highly, highly recommend!This TI scientific calculator was easy to use instantly.  Clearly written and thorough instructions that made it simple to operate.  I haven't had use for all of the functions, and probably never will, but for high school and college, this will do very nicely.This is a very nice calculator for high school students in higher math - algebra, trig, pre-calculus. The two line display is an added bonus. Can't beat the price for the functionality.I got this at the Big Box retailer that I despise.  Apparently, they only carry this in black.  URGH!!!  I LOVE that it comes in pink.  (Totally would have bought it on Amazon had I known about it.  Every day I find more and more things to buy on Amazon with my Prime Membership, not that I'm plugging Amazon, but I love Amazon.)  I also love that this shows two lines for previous entries.  That was the major selling point for me for when I do my accounting online homework - my laptop computer doesn't have the numeric keys, so it's frustrating to have to use the numbers above the QWERTY keyboard, and it's also time consuming. I love this calculator - very useful.Too much error code...does not work for me and gives a lot of problems.  I will used it when I have no other choice.  Texas Instruments are always good.  Not sure why I am not having a good experience with this one.When working properly, these are wonderful calculators: affordable, simple to learn, fuctional, small, comes with case, easy to reset the memory, etc.It's not as bulky or expensive as something like the TI-89 and on series of graphing calculators.I recommend these calculators for all my chemistry classes. I've never had to use the sin, cos, and tan buttons, but one feature that is especially useful in science class is the ability to shift between scientific notation and normal notation (end, sci/eng, right, enter). It sounds more complicated than it really is and once you do it once, you'll be fine.Occasionally, there are individual calculators that will have poorly made buttons that stick a little. In that case, you have to be extra careful when inputting data, but usually this gets fixed with enough use.Conclusion: Good choice for science class.Like others have posted this is not as pictured.  The design is not the floral or the geometric as the two pictured.  The design part in these pictures is all white on the calculator I received.  If this is a big deal to you, you may want to go to a store where you can pick the design you want.  For me the pink color met my requirements.A great basic non graphing scientific calculator at a great price.  My school bookstore charges $20 for these and only has them in black.  Pink makes it stand out so you know it is yours and makes doing math more fun!It is solar powered with a battery back up.  It has a cover that snaps on the back when you dont need it shut, and there is a cheat sheet for the functions that is in the cover.  I love Texas Instruments, they make products meant to last.  This is a nice quality plastic making it very durable and last a life time.Cannot beat the price, and Prime 2 day free shipping.  Always looking to save a buck.I used this calculator throughout college and it served me well. For all your non-graphing calculator needs this is the calculator for you. It has all the necessary functions and many more that I never used. Overall solid buy and it has lasted me well over 5 years without any issues.Unless your instructor requires you for having high class graphic calculator that you can see entire graph on the screen, this calculator does good job through lower calc class. I got this a bit over $10 at Wal-Mart, and it's been lasting 3+ years now. No issues or no problem whatsoever.Thankfully amazon had a great supply of scientific calculators, since sadly I had never heard of them until I received my daughter's supply list for middle school.  Exactly what she needs for math.  Powered by solar so you never need batteries.  Cool color...enough said.Main Points:I used this calculator for over 10 years before it finally stopped working, and I treated it fairly roughly (e.g.,coffe spills).  I think others here have attested to the functionality of the TI-30, so I just want to emphasize that it's a tough little gadget as well. Yes, the buttons are on the small side and there is a bit of play, but this was never a major problem (although at times it slows down data entry). You can go to [...] for a good overview of TI calculators, and you can scope out one of TI's major competitors at [...]A Little History:This was also one of the first commercially available low-priced calculators that had two-line display and backspace to correct or edit data entry.  The dual-power and scrolling display features were also once unusual.  The top line (for data entry) shows up to 11 characters; you can scroll backwards or forwards up to 88! The bottom line (shows results) displays up to a 10-digit answer along with a 2-digit exponent.Individual Needs Differ:From the reviews here, it appears that high school math is now more difficult than it once was.  If you know that you're going to need graphing capability, then obviously this is not the choice for you.  Similarly, the prevalence of laptop computers and math/stats software may obviate the need for some of the more advanced features.Recommendation:The layout is very good and, for such a low price, it packs a lot of calculating might.  However, high school (or college)students may want to narrow their choices and then ask their teacher which one has the most relevant functions for the next few years of math. Compared to twenty-five or so years ago, one can now get a lot more calculator for the money. Depending on your budget, therefore, you might determine that a calculator like this is sufficient for your short-term needs, but that you'll need a new one if you go on to more advanced stats and math.  In any event, this is a durable calculator that works very well.These ubiquitous texas instrument calculator that everyone thinks are so great are complete garbage.  Compared to 15c or 42s by HP this is not a tool, but a child's toy or just a piece of land fill luggage.I looked everywhere for a calculator that would help with my son's Geometry. This seemed to fit the bill. Nice size display and a nice instruction guide. I'm sure he'll be using this ALOT.This is my third Texas Instruments calculator.  I also have a TI-84 and a Voyage 200, both of which I love.  I bought this one because I needed a no-frills scientific calculator for my Diff Eq class.  I didn't have a lot of money to spend, so this one seemed to fit the bill.  I wish I had gone to a bricks and mortar store and tried it against some other ones, though.  It has all the functions I want, including storing the previous answer, but the buttons don't always register a key press.  It is really frustrating to be in the middle of a test and have the calculator get temperamental.  It is especially bad when I don't notice it happened and mess up a problem because the button didn't register.  It's not an issue with the buttons being difficult to press, either.  The button presses just don't get picked up some times.I purchased this calculator after the first one I bought for her, this one:Texas Instruments Inc. TI-84 Plus Silver Edition Blue Graphing Calculator (Packaging may vary)was rejected by my sister's math teacher as being too complex for a basic algebra class. The teacher approved of this one, and my sister was able to use it successfully in her math class.This is an item that does what it says it does. Comes in good shape and works well. What more can I say?Overall I do not recommend this product. I remember this calculator from several years ago during various math classes. Bought this as a replacement as I require a calculator with specific test specifications. Works great and very intuitive, however the keys require just enough more pressure than they used to so that it is annoying. Perhaps they will become broken in. Not yet though.This is a great item for basic scientific calculations. It does not do all the functions of the somewhat higher models in the product line but meets my needs just right. And a great bargain at less than $13.I have two teenagers going to the local community college and my wife just started college too. We had my old TI-30X scientific from when I went for my MBA so we ordered two more of he TI-30X which is the updated version of the same calculator I had.  Can't beat the price and color selection.Bought this product recently based on recommendations for an advanced math/ scientific calculator.  Apparently, TI has almost all the schools eating out of their hands by having classrooms make these calculators mandatory in many classes.I will say that the calculator features a lot and you can even purchase more applications to dowload at TI's Website.  However, the calculator is complicated to use, and you almost need a course to learn how to use it.  Furthermore, the functionality is poorly designed and if you press a wrong button the calculator will often freeze on you.At the high price for these TI calculators you would think that they would have gotten all the bugs out.  But let me assure you they are definitely there, and you would be better served to get a Casio or HP graphing calculator instead.Have been using this for a college math class. Does everything I need it to, and a lot more that I have not figured out yet.This is a pricey but versatile calculator.  Yes, there are better, more advanced calculators out there for the advanced mathematics and scientific user.  And yes, this item should be priced much lower than it is, considering it has been on the market for a long time.  However, for use in an academic setting, consider that there exists a lot of  teaching materials out there in the classrooms, as well as activities, that are built around this model.  So, because of that, this model has survived all this time.I bought this calculator to use in a Corporate Finance class.  Calculating Time Value of Money problems with this was much easier than using the BA II Plus.  The inputs are easier to enter, without having to memorize long sequences of key strokes.Your instructor and the class activities will most likely dictate which brand and model of calculator to purchase, rather than a reviewer's recommendations.  However, one bit of advice I can give you is very important to remember:  Please, use regular 1.5v alkaline batteries should you purchase this model.  The rechargeable batteries, with their 1.2v, will not be enough to give you a clear display.  A set of four batteries will last a very long time.  However, it would not be a bad idea to carry a spare pack of 4 in your briefcase or backpack.  You would not want to run out of battery in the middle of an important exam.  This calculator, unlike the more basic models, will not run on solar power.Parents: If you're going to buy your child a graphing calculator for school, DON'T insult his/her intelligence with this limited function calculator. Go with a TI-86 or TI-89 as it will serve him/her well through into college. What this means is you save money by purchasing one calculator that will be useful for SATs, GREs, AP tests, high school, algebra, calculus 1-3, college, etc...If you buy a TI-83, you will have to get a TI-86 or TI-89 in the future because a TI-83 is an OVERGLORIFIED TI-82, which is really good for pre-algebra and algebra.GRANTED you can use a TI-83 for Calculus and more advanced math, but it's a good idea to allow your child to grow intellectually by learning how to use a much more advanced calculator for Calc II and III. I had no problems using a TI-86 for Calc 2 and 3, but the TI-89 definitely helped me understand theorems that were in 3 dimensions.For those who are looking for a calculator to use at work:The TI-83 is a piece of junk. It's for kiddies in 6th grade.The TI-86 is a better engineering calc than the TI-89 due to its more intuitive menu interface for units conversions and what not.The TI-89 is better suited for theoretical math work because of its "pretty print" and units system. Plus with the right software mods, you can do differentiation/integration with the variables intact - just a time saver really.However I realize you're just trying to find info on the TI-83. My overall recommendation for the TI-83 is: don't bother. It's a solid calculator but pay a bit more and get at least a TI-86. It will serve you WELL into frosh or sophomore year of college (Calculus I-III). A TI-83 will have served its absolute purpose by the start of your senior year in high school.It's like bringing a 9mm pistol in an African Safari. It will handle meerkats and other small creatures but once you get to the larger predators - it will not work very well. The TI-86 and TI-89 is comparable to a .50AE and .50 Magnum. It can tackle small stuff but will hold its own when the big beasts come around.One of these calculators is probably one of the most useful things you can have in high school, especially if you are taking classes such as algebra 2, geometry, physics, pre-calculus, or calculus. No matter what you will always find yourself using one of these calculators in high school, they are very powerful calculators that have a great advantage over a standard calculator because it has the ability to have programs on it and because it is a graphing calculator. These calculators can even be used during tests such as the SAT! It gives you a better advantage if you know how to use one of these well. The only downside to these calculators is that they require 4 AAA batteries, they last a pretty long time though because the screen doesn't take up much power. Some people might complain that the screen is too low resolution to today's standards or that it isn't a backlit screen,  but this screen is what allows for greater battery use, you wouldn't want your calculator to power off during an exam. So although this calculator is from 1999 it is still a good calculator that you won't regret getting.I rate the TI-83 Plus 5 out of 5 stars.I hope this review helped you out!Math is not my best subject and this calculator is perfect. I highly recomend it for students from high school on.Worked exactly as described.  Didn't love statistics, but the calculator sure made the class a lot easier.  Would recommend this!Product arrived in the condition and of a quality that I expected. It is a standard black color and functions as expected.classic TI-83. it's back - or at least never left. the price is still up there, but let's not get into that. works beautifully and calls back memories of calculus class back in high school. easy to use, great features.Bottom-Line: The Texas Instruments "TI-83 Plus Graphing Calculator" is probably the last calculator you will purchase in your academic career, it is just that powerful.It's time for me to head back to school, DeVry University's Keller Graduate School of Management that is.  This time I am in pursuit of my MBA with a concentration in Networking and Telecommunications. Why pursue a boring ole traditional MBA when new technology is to be learned?  So that means math; lots of math; loads of math in the form of algebra, calculus, and the ever dread statistics.Did I mention that I hate math!?  What does one do when one hates math, but still needs to do it in spades?  Buy a calculator of course, but not just any calculator I needed a calculator cable of doing complex mathematics including graphing equations.  My very first course called for a Texas Instruments "TI-83 Plus Graphing Calculator."Powered by (4) AAA-sized batteries (plus 1 CR-1616 or CR 1620 lithium battery for backup), the "TI-83 Plus Graphing Calculator" is large unit ideal for advanced mathematics students high school algebra to college-level calculus, and statistics.  The TI-83 Plus packs a lot of mathematical punch and the price of $127.00 (Office Depot.com) certainly confirms it.The TI-83 Plus calculator combines features for statistical analysis, engineering, trigonometric and financial functions making it ideal for a student seeking an MBA.  Financial functions include TVM, cash flows and amortization, though surprisingly a percentage key is missing from the calculator.The two pound (yes, it is heavy, kind of) TI-83 Plus features a non-backlit 64x96 pixel grey scale LCD screen that is frankly hard to read unless the lighting is exactly right.  But the LCD display can display graphs and tables on a full as well as split-screen.  And the display exhibits up to (12) characters and eight lines.  The calculator can graph/trace equations while scrolling through table values.  And the TI-83 Plus can store and analyze up to 10 equations.I also purchased the optional TI-Graph Link (software and USB cable).  The software and cable allows one to connect the TI-83 Plus to a computer via a USB port permitting the transfer of files and data between the two devices.My ThoughtsAmple time should be given to learning what the TI-83 Plus can bring to the table.  All of the nine digits are there of course, but the face of the calculator contains a whole lot more in the form of multi-colored special function buttons; and there are a lot of them!  However, the TI-83 Plus ships with very detailed, instruction manual, so I plan to carry it with me at all times.As I stated above, and it is worth restating, the TI-83 Plus's non-backlit LCD is a little difficult to read when the unit is lying flat on a desk and a lot will depend on the lighting conditions.  Even with the right lighting, the top line of the display is hard to read.Though I was stunned by the high price of the unit the "Texas Instruments TI-83 Plus Graphing Calculator" is probably the last calculator you will purchase in your academic career, it is just that powerful.  You can buy it for a high school student and (s)he can use it through graduate school.I purchase these cards frequently to make my own birthday, Christmas and other holiday greetings. This is the best price I have ever paid for them and they arrived quickly. The cards themselves are of high quality and help me create a final product I can be proud of.This is a really good, high-quality product.  It saves money because you can do it yourself.  It also saves time and gas - instead of going to the store, you can just do it yourself.High quality product - very highly recommended.Not very many people nowadays still write paper letters.  But, believe it or not, I still have a few people that I still correspond with on paper and snail mail.  I do prefer snail mail rather than any other way.  This is a good way to have some stationery in which to write a letter on.no, you won't fool anyone into thinking that these are commercial-quality cards, but they're pretty good. i prefer the matte finish over glossy which tend to have even flimsier paper. the size of these cards are basically a piece of 8.5"x11" paper folded in half, so that makes these larger than a normal commercial greeting card. but since they're "regular paper-sized," it's easy to design your own elements and print without worrying about sizing, orientation, etc...this is fine for casual card-making. despite using your printer's ink, it's still cheaper than buying greeting cards. it's a good option for a home hobbyist or for making last-minute cards if you don't feel like going to the store.I like the larger size and the very whiteness of the paper. The matte paper really takes in a lot of the inks so the result is sometimes stunning. I only mark it down one star because I wish it were just a bit stiffer.I love making my own greeting cards.  These work perfectly with my canon inkjet printer.I like to take tons of pictures at parties and get togethers.  It is amazing how many funny looking faces some people make while trying to smile for a photo especially a big group.  There will always be one in the middle of doing something else instead of getting the smile right.  I like to take and isolate that one and later for their birthday or something make a funny card.  Or put funny sayings in word balloons over their heads and make a funny card.People like personalized cards and not only that, this is so much cheaper than cookie cutter cards at the store.  My friends all seem to look forward to my cards so I use lots of these Avery Half Fold products.Sometimes I want to create an especially personal card for someone and these half fold cards and envelopes make for a very nice end product.  There is a finish to one side that helps make the printed graphics look better than if the paper were not coated.The weight of this card stock is perfect for my ink jet printer and feeds smoothly.  The fold line is so slight that you can use the page whole if you want and not fold it at all.  It also lends itself to being cut in half for single page note cards.  I've already made three sets featuring original art for Christmas presents.I've tried three other brands of half-fold card stock and all have been too heavy to feed smoothly through my printer.  The resulting cards show lines of print instead of a smooth picture--not exactly professional quality.  This product is perfect.  It's a good weight for a greeting card or note card and has a smooth bright white finish.  It can be folded into a half fold card via the scored line as designed, but doesn't have to be and the faint line isn't obvious if the page is left whole for a printed notice where you want some heft, like for a yard sale or lost pet.  If you cut the cards in half for note cards and miss the scored line by a tiny amount, it doesn't show so your note cards still look perfect.I will definitely buy more of these cards.  Highly recommended.I'm a digital photography enthusiast and this product has given me the ability to make stunning personalized cards for family and friends.  Very easy to use straight out of the box.  These cards reproduce photographs very nicely, in bright, vibrant color.The half-fold is nice as it gives you plenty of room for artwork and personalized messages on the inside.  Highly recommended.I created a whole group of Christmas cards with these. They look great and were fun to do. I'm ordering more so I can finish my card list.This product consists of decent quality 8.5 x 11 matte card stock with a partial laser perforation in  the middle so the it folds in half evenly. 25 envelopes are included in the package. This is larger than a typical greeting card, but the size makes it easy to use with just about any printer. The paper accepts and absorbs the ink without seeping through or veining in the paper fibers. The paper color is not bright white, but is appropriate for a greeting card.The package insert, dated 2007, states that Avery DesignPro software is Windows only. However, Avery DesignPro for Mac OSX is now available as a free download on the Avery.com software page. Avery DesignPro for Mac is a basic graphic design and layout program which includes templates for most Avery products, including Avery/American Greetings Half Fold Blank Cards (3265). This is the easiest way I know of to use this kind of product. In addition, Avery DesignPro includes a printer calibration feature. Absolute precision is not so critical on greeting cards, but if you're printing 90-per-page return address labels, a fraction of an inch one way or the other can run a whole sheet of labels.My printer (an HP 7180) has a duplex (two-sided printing) attachment. The DesignPro software will print both sides on the same job. The trick is to choose Short-edge Binding in the print dialog box. If you choose long-edge, the inside of the card will print upside down on the wrong page. The preview in the print dialog box does not show the inside page, but it does print. If your printer does not have a duplex attachment, then you simply print page 1 only, flip the paper over and then print page 2 only. I'd suggest trying this once or twice with plain paper, so you know exactly how to flip the paper for your particular printer.To me, these products fall in the etiquette scale between  a hand-written note on your personal letterhead and a greeting card you bought in the grocery store. They do show you put some time and effort into the communication.This product provides a certain amount of convenience but is not anything special. It is 8.5x11-in. card stock for inkjet printers, with a crease in the middle for folding. It has a template number for use with word-processing and creative-project software, but templates can often be more trouble than they are worth, especially for the simple task of dividing a simple letter-sized sheet into two parts. There is a convenience, to be sure, in having correct-sized envelopes packaged with the paper; but again, there is nothing special about this size of envelope; and they feel somewhat flimsy, not exactly something in which to encase the results of your artistic labors.Plain is OK, but to get a top rating from me this product would have needed to have been special in some way, such as perhaps being glossy on half of one side in order to provide a space in which to print a photo vibrantly.These are nice sturdy cards and envelopes that print up very nice and crisp. They are not photo cards but a slightly shiny card stock, they fold so easily on the fold mark, fit the envelopes nicely and no extra postage required. I used microsoft digital image suite to make my cards and it works perfectly with these, I used pictures of my pets to make Christmas cards and they turned out rather nice. These are not fancy cards but are nice enough to send out to others.I have been using this Avery half-fold greeting card stock for more than ten years.  I have tried other vendors and generic alternatives, but I have always gone back to Avery because of the print quality that you get from this product.On both sides of the greeting card, the printed output is smooth, crisp and sharp, yielding nice images.  There is no bleeding of the inkjet colors into the fibers of the paper.  The greeting card has a matt-coated finish on one side for the nice reproduction of pictures and images.  The card has a slight crease for easy folding.  I use Printshop for making cards, so I have never tried the free templates and software.I'm usually dissapointed in card makers but these are the best I have every used.  The paper looks much better right out of the box, works great in the printer, does not smear and most important gives you a photo-like image on the paper.They are a nice big size and come with their own envelopes (which is good since they are so big).  The images are really as good as premium photo paper when compared side by side.  They fold well, envelopes are good quality also.These might cost a little more than generic ones but well worth the price, cannot find one bad thing to say about them.I usually use Hallmark's greeting card paper and like it a lot.  Avery's product is equally good.  It is a true matte finish, so if you want a little more shine, this isn't for you.  The stock is thick enough that the printing doesn't show through and the fold is neat and professional.  No need to buy pre made cards if you have these on hand.  I use American Greeting's printable option a lot but my kids like to make their own cards with it.  They look much better than trying to fold your own card stock.  I would highly recommend these.My wife enjoys the creative process and personal touch of making/designing her own Special Occasion cards for family and friends.  The package of Avery white half-fold greeting cards containing 20 each of card stock and envelopes, is perfect for this endeavor.  The best feature of the card is the well-defined fold line, which helps when determining what side is the best or correct side, for the front of the card. The quality and sturdiness of the card stock is a big plus. It is a good weight...not heavy, but not too light, either! The paper accepts all the colored inks well, with the printing and pictures clear and clean-looking. The designs can slightly show through if printed on both sides, but that is not a big distraction.  She will definitely order this product again.I love this card stock. Nice weight, nice white tone, and the ink-jet prints on it are superior. They make it easy.I like this brand of card stock - nice weight; ink absorbs evenly, and the paper is scored, making folding the paper into a card easy and precise.This is nice thick card stock that does not bleed through. I used these for invitations and printed a full color picture on front, black & white print with a color image inside and a color image on the back. They looked fantastic! Of course I did need to keep the pages separated for a minute, so the ink could dry, but nothing smeared and they looked fabulous. The only trouble I had was that I couldn't find an option for this Avery size in my Word 7, so I used what I thought was closest to that size and it worked just fine (and that is why I didn't give it 5 stars). I would definitely purchase these again!this Avery greeting card paper works great for me. I never had it jam up my printer maybe its because I separate all the pages first to see if any are stuck together. then re-stack how may I want to print put paper in printer and print away. my cards turn out very well I will buy this paper again.I found the cards to be simple to load, and the card stock itself is firm and easy to handle.  I like these larger cards for relatives whose vision isn't great.  The background is crisp and white and takes color well, whether text, clip art, or photos.  There is a heavy-weight version of this product, but I don't see the point in making greeting cards that last 100 years...Perfect cardstock for creating my own greeting cards on my inkjet printer.  I used the templates for Microsoft Word, and they fed nicely into my Canon MP830.  Totally satisfied and will use this for future cards.Avery and American Greetings have gotten together to create a product that will be giving your local card store a run for its money.Got a PC? A color printer?  Like to collect clip art? Or are you an amature photographer? Well, combine that with a simple program (like Microsoft's PUBLISHER) and you will be churning out unique, one-of-a-kind cards in a matter of minutes.The great part is, all the cards reflect you and your style. No longer do you have to contend with searching for "the perfect card" when you can create it (and personalize it) at home.I take photos and importing them on the Half Fold Blank Cards is a snap.  You can add a greeting (no more "Happy Birthday" but you can add the person's name as well) and you really are showing somebody how much you care (Sorry Hallmark, I couldn't resist the jab).This product produces professional cards that are just as good (sometimes better) than the ones you buy in the card stores.Avery/ American Greetings provide you with envelopes so all you need is a little talent and wait until you see the end product!These cards are made of pretty good card stock with nice envelopes.  The template I downloaded did not have any envelope printing option; there was only a template for the card.  Designing the card took a little bit of experimenting before I got the writing and picture to be organized correctly in the template.  There are really no guides in the template. It also took me a while to orient the paper correctly in the printer, but once that worked, the output of the picture on the card cover was rich.This is for inkjet printers only and before I selected this product, I had missed that description.  I did try it in my laser printer with the duplex option set and the card stock got jammed as expected.  However, it did print the front of the card beautifully before that happened.  I then printed a saying on regular paper and glued it to the back of the card.  Obviously, if you have an inkjet printer, you won't have to do this. Instead, I had my friend use this product on her inkjet printer. Below is her review:"The paper has the perfect weight for card stock.  The paper fed through my printer with ease each time (not too thick), and it worked well for double sided printing with no bleed through.  Both black and color ink printed perfectly.  I would purchase this brand card stock paper again."In summary, if you like printing your own cards and have an inkjet printer, then this Avery product is a good option.If you want to send a largish greeting card with plenty of room for photos or images, this is just what you need.  So many of the print your own card kits produce small cards.  These are grate for photos - big enough so you can notice them across the room and be drawn to see them better.I tried printing photo greeting cards on this paper with two different printers - an Epson Artisan 810 and an HP OfficeJet 6500A - and had a very positive experience with both. In the past, I have had greeting card papers jam or refuse to feed unless the paper goes in from the top, but I had no difficulties with either printer in this case. The colors were a bit richer coming from the Epson printer, and I'm sure it's because that printer utilizes six ink cartridges and is designed more specifically for photo printing. However, the results were very close, and I was very happy with the prints from both machines. Colors are bright and clear, and the details are sharp. The cards have a nice feel to them and the scoring in the middle of the sheets make them very easy to fold cleanly and evenly. With the matte finish, the ink is dry and okay to handle as soon as the prints come out of the printer. I'm very happy with this paper and would buy it again for gifts and my own personal use.This is a great size for a holiday letter card where you can print a photo on the cover and your letter on the inside, works easier if your printer does doublesided automatically.Ever have a day when you need a card and you don't have one on hand? Avery White Half-Fold Greeting Cards are nice to have to quickly and easily create a nice looking card. The paper is sturdier and nicer looking than normal printer paper.  I think at a half page size, they are a little big and the envelopes are a little cheap looking.  My huge recommendation is to always print your card on a piece of normal paper to make sure it is right before using this paper. Since I messed one up, I printed a half page size card. I like that size better, but then you need to have your own envelopes or do without. Making two per page would make the cards more economical, too. It is very easy to find pre-made designs that fit this template size. Even a beginner could make a card in minutes. I used a non-color laser printer and by choosing a black and white design, the cards look great.  Overall, I like these and if they save a trip to the store...I love them.This Half-Fold  style along with  Avery's Quarter Fold heavy paper stock is the perfect medium to use for those who prefer to send personalized greeting cards.  Sure, you can use standard printer paper, but these scored sheets are whiter, brighter and make the colors and text pop, and it gives your cards ( that you worked long and hard on) that professional look.  These packages all come with matching envelopes which make it a great deal.  I don't  go out and spend $5-6.00 PER CARD for those  generic cards you get at drug stores anymore....... that's ridiculous.  I love designing and personalizing the cards I send out at a fraction of the cost.I had some less-expensive half-fold cards that I had purchased previously.  I assumed that the same card (same pictures, words and fonts) would look about the same on them both.  After all, they were both Avery products.  To test my theory, I test-printed the same thing (using the same fonts and the same picture) on both cards.  I was amazed at the difference!  The words were sharper and clearer on these cards.  However, where they really stood out was the clarity of the picture!  The picture on the other card was acceptable -- until I put them side-by-side for comparison!  On this card, the colors were more vivid, and the picture was a lot sharper.  In fact, when compared to this card-stock, the picture on the less expensive paper looked faded and washed out (something I probably would've never noticed if I hadn't seen the side-by-side comparison).  I'm still having a hard time believing that different card-stock can make such a diffence.  The difference really is that noticeable.  These more expensive half fold cards are definitely worth the extra expense, and I will buy them in the future.I also like that you can download free templates from [&#8230;] templates (something that is true of all Avery products).  When using Avery's free templates, you have four options:1 - Avery Templates (a simple and basic download, and it works with MS Word & Adobe programs);2 - Avery Wizard for MS Office (a download that gives more options than the basic option and makes MS Word even easier to use);3 - Avery Design & Print Online (Online version that does not require a download, unfortunately I couldn't figure out how to do single labels without printing an entire page of the same label);4 - Avery DesignPro (a download that allows even more features than basic or MS Office templates.  All the templates are free, and you can use them with multiple Avery products (labels, gift cards, etc.)I used this cardstock to make Christmas tags for my son's preschool goodie bags and I had no problems printing them on an inkjet printer.  I also used these cards and Avery's DesignPro software to print Christmas cards and they looked like something I could have bought at the store.  I was really impressed with the papers and would definitely use them again as well as recommend them to others.The avery Half-Fold Greeting Cards for Inkjet Printers are great for Greeting Cards and Invitations. I have made Invitatons and Greeting Cards with ease using this kit. You can easly download Avery Templates and Software to help you make beautiful cards everyone will enjoy receiving.The paper quality is good, and there is a wide variety of templates to choose from on the Avery web site.  The templates range from wedding invitations to get well cards, to office-oriented announcement cards.  You have to provide the actual text; but the background images are part of the templates. You can also design and print your cards via their web site; it generates a PDF file that you print one side at a time.  Helpful instructions are close by.  The templates on the web site are for all versions of Microsoft Word; I had no trouble opening them with OpenOffice.org software.This is a nice heavy weight cardsotck.  It is not of exceptional quality - pretty much the basic cardstock paper you can find in big packages at the local craft or discount store.  It works well for run-of-the-mill cards like larger quantities of Christmas cards, but I prefer to use a better quality for special cards. Still, it works well for its price.The cards and envelopes are a good quality paper and have a nice feel to them.  I like to use my own photos designs for cards and  these will be perfect for Christmas this year.I've been using these in my HP 1610 inkjet printer and they work great.  Text and photos come out crisp and vibrant.  I downloaded the template from Avery and it works perfectly in OpenOffice.The best thing about these is that they are pre-folded.  This provides a much better result than using regular card stock.My only complaint, which is minor, is that I wish the paper was just a little bit thicker/heavier.  Other than that, I'm very happy with the overall quality and will probably order another box when this one is used up.This is a really nice card making kit.  The card stock is very heavy and a nice texture. It's easy to format and includes envelopes.  I do think the large envelopes would need extra postage if you are mailing them.The kids and I had a blast making cards last month for Christmas and Thank You's. The cards printed out beautifully and saved us a trip to the card shop (and some big $$$ spent there usually). I am going to keep these in stock at home for our card needs. A+Have used this many times before and this site had one of the best prices.  Crisp colors and quality paperIt's been a while since I've used actual greeting card paper to make my photo greeting cards.  The first time I made greeting cards on a PC, I used HP greeting card paper, which I found on clearance.  I loved making photo cards!  Unfortunately, I realized greeting card paper was a bit costly when not on clearance, so I turned to other paper for my cards.  Mostly, I have made them onCanon Matte Photo Paper, 8.5 x 11 Inches, 50 Sheets (7981A004).  (Note, however, I have not bought this paper since 2005, when I stocked up on it, because it was so cheap.  Thus, I don't know if Canon has changed anything about the paper or not.  The box itself looks different.)  It is basically inexpensive photo paper, and has no Canon name on the reverse side, so you can print your greetings on that side.  (Just make certain you print the photo on the right side.  If not, it will look horrendous, whereas words look just fine.  Hold the paper up to a lamp to find the brightest white side for the photo.)  It also folds relatively easily.  If you want your card on glossy paper, use glossy photo paper for your photograph, pastel or bright bonded paper for your message, and tape or paste the bonded paper to the back of the glossy paper. (All glossy paper I have ever seen has the brand's name on the back, so messages can't be printed there.)  Then, just get a box of envelopes that fit your cards, such asColumbian CO468 Grip-Seal Invitation Envelopes A9, 5-3/4" x 8-3/4" - White (Box of 100).If you want it quick and easy, though, do get these Avery greeting cards.  The envelopes are included, and the card paper is already half folded, so there's no struggle in getting the card folded just right.  The photos I printed on these cards looked almost as good as the photos printed on matte photo paper.  I used 10 of these Avery cards to make a stationery set for friends.  I printed photos of their dogs on the front of the cards, and left the insides blank for "newsy" notes.  Since the envelopes in this pack come bounded in two sets of ten, that worked out quite well.  I included one of the envelope sets with the cards, and had a very nice Christmas gift for my friends. I don't think the included envelopes are quite as nice as the Columbian ones, but they certainly will do. Also, when making a quarter card, while folding the half card in half, the card tore in half!  So, you might want to watch out for that, or get quarter card paper for your smaller cards.  Making greeting cards on the computer is lots of fun, and Avery makes it simple with these half-fold greeting cards!I am on my third pack of Avery half-fold cards in only about a year's time. I love this product! Aside from the typical print-out greeting cards, I use the cardstock for a couple of other things as well: (1) They're scored deeply enough that they rip in half easily. Once ripped in half, I cut along the line to make it look neater, fold each half of cardstock in half, and then make two handmade cards out of one sheet. (2) The cardstock works really well as a cover when creating half-fold booklet projects.One thing that's different about this product from others is that it comes with envelopes. Plenty of other brands only sell cardstock in packs, and this envelope size isn't always easy to find. The printing is also less likely to smear than some other types of heavy paper since the surface isn't glossy.The only negative I have to say is that this packet used to come with 25 cards and envelopes (my old box reads: "5 more cards! Now with 25 cards."). I really wish Avery had kept the pack at a larger size and not taken it back down to 20. The actual product is great, though, and something I use frequently.These cards allow us to make beautiful, personalized custom cards at a fraction of what we'd pay for those overpriced, impersonal store-bought ones.  I can have 25 hand drawn Avery cards for less than the price of one fancy store-bought one, or if I print them, including ink, it would still be less than $1/card.The kids used the Avery cards for the first time today, making some cards for a friend's birthday.  They came out looking so nice and polished.  We didn't even bother with the printer; they just drew right on them.  They will have even more fun when we've got more time to experiment, with glitter, buttons, stickers, cut outs, etc.  I'm looking forward to scanning in some of their favorite drawings and using them for cover art.  Or making a Father's Day card with a photo of the kids and their dad.  I think I'll make a birthday card for my dad from his dog, with a picture of his dog on the cover and googly eyes pasted on.The card stock is nice and heavy, is a nice bright white that shows true colors, and is scored for easy folding.  The folds come out crisp but not at all flimsy.Knowing Avery products as I do, I'm sure they will work like a dream in my printer, but I will update my review when I have an opportunity to do a card on the printer.These greeting cards worked really good. I was looking for a card size more like the ones you buy in the store but these were inexpensive and you get 20 of them. Good deal. I Payed the price I would pay for one Hallmark card and got 20 of them. This is fun for the whole family both making and receiving them.Great card stock, excellent paper and it worked great with my inkjet printer.  I chose cute Christmas card design, my photo and my personal message and was done in minutes!  But... I didn't like starting with just blank cards.  For advanced users I'm sure it's what everybody wants, blank slate so their imagination runs wild.  But I wanted to at least start with some color and pre-printed borders, so all I would need to pick is my pictures and write my message.  Overall, still 5 out of 5.Great bang for the buck.  Buy it, and I promise you will not be disappointed.This is a good calculator for those who are taking business classes.  This is helpful for those taking introductory courses in Accounting and also in Finance.  You can also use this to check your Excel spreadsheet and make sure that your formulas are correct.  This can be especially helpful when setting up an amortization table.  However, if your teacher will allow it, you may be better off with a graphing calculator, like a Ti-83.  You can use the Ti-83's TVM functions to do the same things, and it is a little bit easier to learn.Another thing to consider, for those who will be taking exams, is that you will need to master the functions of whatever model calculator will be allowed on the test.  While I prefer the TI-83, it may not be allowed in the CPA Exam, for example.I bought the calculator for Accounting classes, and now it is just laying there not used. But it is good enough for the first Accounting classes, then you do better upgrade your calculator.I got this calculator at request from my Corporate Finance professor.Its the student version and pretty easy to use -- key thing being that you regularly clear your work from memory in between TVM problems.Once you get the hang of it, its very fast to calculate PV, NPV, FV, Cost of Capital, etc.Its not as solidly made as the TI-85's I had in Calc as an undergrad, but its small, lightweight and easy to use --- worth the 28$ and actually a bit quicker to solve finance problems than MS Excel(Note:  for real world NPVs, I do use Excel since thats more repetitive work and involves alot of different scenario modeling that would be less efficient on a manual calculator.)David Wilson: Thank you my man for your review of the TI BA II. I was getting ready to junk my old 80's 12C when I noticed in your review of the TI something that made me go back and do something that put my 12C back into action.  You saved me some dollars and time. I was about to buy the TI but no need now.Great product. Everything I need as a finance guy. All I need now is my books to be this cheap.I have not had a chance to really learn the complex functions. The buttons are a nice size and not sensitive. I am planning to use it for the CFA preparation and exam. I am overall very pleased with it.This calculator worked perfectly for my Finance class- easy to use and no issues whatsoever. Highly recommend for your finance needs! Thanks!VALUE PERFORMER GETS NEW LOOKBA2+ users may like to know that Texas Instruments has released a "new look" TI BA2+ (allow me to call it it BA2+N), which may come with just more than cosmetic improvements over the popular BA2+.IMPROVED LCD DISPLAYI was able to observed from a short distant away that the LCD display of the BA2+N,is clearer and more contrasty than the orginal BA2+ which I own. TI gets a thumbs up for doing this improvement quietly plus giving a facelift to this already highly regarded value for money business-financial electronic calculator.DID TEXAS INSTRUMENT KILLED SOME BUGS IN THE BA2+?Although I have not yet been able to test the BA2+N, TI may have also incorporated some improvements and killed some bugs on the popular BA2+. It is also probable that some improvements or new functions incorporated on the September 2004 released BA2+ Professional (BA2+PRO) may also have been also incorporated into the specs of BA2+N.I would like to believe that some small but extremely annoying bugs of the "original" BA2+ has been quietly fixed on the BA2+N. In particular, I wish to see the "Reset" button nuisance which clears all user input formatting on the BA2+ has been done alway with. Most users of BA2+ would know that an accident user soft reset would return to the default Number of Periods per year P/Y to 12, this would upset the results of many TVM calculations when user has set the P/Y to "1" to use the calculator in "number of periods" instead.BATTERY REPLACEMENT WOES ON THE BA2+I was not able to exam a unit of the BA2+N to see if end users would still need a screw driver to unscrew and pry open the BA2+ casing just to replace the CR2032 battery. It would be nice if TI would incorporate a user accessible slide open battery compartment for the BA2+N or future upgrades of the BA2+.MY RECOMMENDATIONWould be buyers should get hold of the BA2+N or buy the BA2+PRO if you have a bigger budget. Budget conscious users could see that for the price of a BA2+ PRO, a screw driver and spare batteries, new users could afford to purchase for themselves two sets of BA2+N.An advantage of having a spare BA2+N set on hand is that users could free themselves from the trouble of carrying a philips screwdriver and replacement lithium batteries to important assignments or to the examination centre.HOW DIFFERENT DOES THE BA2+N LOOKS? I have downloaded the BA2+N JPEG picture from TI's calculator site and posted it to the Amazon's picture gallery.IMPORTANT NOTE:I have commented on the BA2+N as an end user and I don't work for TI, HP or any of the manufacturers for the products which I have used, reviewed and posted my comments on the pages of Amazon.com. It is my pleasure to be able to share my first look at the BA2+N with you, thanks for reading!This product is for real geeks only. I bought it as a souvenir and office decoration.If you want something serious and practical, get an iphone (or any other smartphone) and a financial calculator app that can do Black-Scholes option pricing and many other fixed income and derivative stuff that this calculator cannot do.I had gotten my first TI calculator in 6th or 7th grade. My TI-83+ has survived about 10 years of being dropped, thrown in frustration, left in hot/cold cars, etc. I bought this calculator for a finance class so that I could enter the calculations I need as they are taught in class rather than figuring it out on my graphing calculator. The first thing I noticed are the keys aren't nearly as good and are kind of annoying to press.  The case isn't very solid at all, I get the feeling if I were to drop it that would be the end of this calculator. As for actual calculation it has been fine so far, but you need to change decimal settings. Out of box it rounds to 2 places, which is inadequate. I recommend setting it to 5.This is a good calculator as would be expected from Texas Instruments, who have been in the calculator business for decades.  A calculator should do the functions that it is supposed to do, which this calculator does.  However, like several other's have noted, the keys can be a challenge.  I've had to start over after entering a number due to the numbers not enterring as they should have.  A good press of the keys takes care of that issue, but most calculators do not need to have the keys pressed firmly for the correct operation...  If Texas Instruments could redesign around the key issue, this would be a five star calculator, as the case and display are well designed. I have only used this calculator for a total of maybe 15 - 20 hours, and the keys may work better over time, but I have not seen any change during the timeframe noted.Update 6/16/11 - I'm hoping that I ended up with a lemon, and that this is not an indicator of TI's quality standards.  I'm dropping my rating from 4 stars to 2 stars.  The decimal button works only when pressed firmly as do several other buttons on this calculator.  When taking a timed test in a finance class, this calculator really failed me because of these issues.  Even being aware of the issues with the calculator I found myself having to redo calculations several times for most of the problems due to the calculator not taking the decimal point.  In over thirty years of using calculators I have never had one with issues like this.  At this point, I'd only recommend this calculator to my enemies, not my friends.My neighbor ordered this and he said it did a great job. He finished in the top 100 in the world in his field so I guess it did the job.I have owned two TI Business Analyst calculators in the past. One finally broke after many years and I replaced it with this one.The functions provided are extremely useful for so many calculations, like the monthly payback on a loan, what the future value of a series of payments into an IRA would yield at some assumed interest rate, discounting a future sum of money by an assume inflation rate, and many other calculations like converting a stated interest rate to a true annual rate and vice-versa and figuring the yield to maturity of a bond. You name it.A VERY useful book comes with the package, better than the book with my last one because it shows clear examples of how to perform different calculations. It will also suggest some things you can do with the calculator that you may not have intended.The calculator is encased in a protective plastic cover that removes from the calcuator and can be either placed to the side or slid onto the bottom of the case to avoid losing it. The keypad has good feedback, nice feel.The only negative, and this is a nit, is that there's no battery hatch. You have to take the case apart to replace the coin battery. I don't know why they've done that but the batteries last so long (5 years?) this shouldn't be an issue.I've seen HP and Sharp financial calculators and in my view considering the TI's price, ease of use, and terrific manual, it's a real winner!I'd been avoiding getting a financial calculator for several years because I thought that it would be too complicated to learn how to use, and that using Excel or just calculating what I needed using algebra would be simpler and less probe to errors.  This calculator was required, by name, for a class I am taking, and I begrudgingly bought it.  I'm glad I did.  I can't believe how easy it is to use.  I still like excel or just doing the math (for simple TVM procedures), but am really impressed with the simplicity of this financial calculator.It is well made, cleanly designed, and a worthwhile purchase.I needed a calculator that could replace my simple desk calculator for quick figures at my desk. This one has done very well and seems like it will last some time. I bought Canon as that was my old brand and I like it although since I have large hands I wish it was a tad bit bigger. It was hard to determine which one to get shopping online but I am happy with it. There really is nothing I would like to change on it and will use it for years. Not much else to say as it is a basic calculator.I used this very calculator at my old office and it lasted for years.  That's why I've kept on buying them.  Of all the calculators I have and use, this is my favorite by far and I use it the most.  The keys are great - they're large and spaced apart to reduce input errors, making this the easiest-to-use calculator I've had.  The display is large, raised and easy to see.What makes this calculator so nice is you barely notice it because it allows you to concentrate on what you're doing.  Sure it doesn't have lots of functions, just the basic ones, but I have another calculator for that.  I tend to use this one all the time and I'd feel lost without it.This is a remarkable, durable and useful calculator.  I'm perform a lot of accounting in my job, and this is my normal go-to calculator.  From the time I ordered it to delivery, only 13.5 hours passed.  That's the fastest I've had an order fulfilled.  Just thought I'd relate that.This is a great calculator for the money; easy to use, display is great. Have purchased Canon calculators in the past, and they are always good quality for the money with great features.An alternative will be Canon LS-82Z. I think they are both competent calculators and do what they are supposed to do, except that the 82Z is $6.66 cheaper! (I should also mention that I calculated that number using a 82Z!)What does another excellent, but smaller Canon calculator -- the  CanonLS-82z -- "want to be when it grows up"?  Right!  THIS calculator -- the Canon LS 85H calculator!``The smaller calculator -- also reviewed for me by Amazon -- is an excellent little machine.  But I can see how its smaller size, (and in particular, smaller keys), would be a problem for those using it on a continual basis.  Men especially, as they tend to have larger hands than women....The slightly larger, Cannon LS 85H calculator, being reviewed here, is almost as perfect a general-purpose calculator as one can find these days!  A handy size, which is at home either on desk-top or pocket/purse."Man-size" keys, which are still not overwhelmingly large, which a person with the largest hands, and also one with the smallest, can usewith the utmost of ease.  The eight-digit display is large, and very well spaced.  Nice little "extras", found in most -- but not all -- other general-purpose calculators: a percent key, a square root key, and a sign change key.  (The sign-change key does not appear on the smaller, LS-82Z).True, the larger LS-85H calculator has an enclosed, "wrap-around" display, (enclosing the entire top part, all together), rather than the "picture-frame" display, (in which the numberic display is indented, and "framed" by the rest of the top of the calculator) of the smaller calculator.  (And I, personally, find the "picture-frame" display far more attractive).  But the larger LS-85H calculator stays on for approximately 3 minutes before turning itself off...approximately a full minute more than the smaller machine, and this may mean more to many users.About the only things missing from this calculator are an "off" key, (not found on the LS-82z, or on most other calculators, either), a "resume" key, (found, at present, only on the large and somewhat cumbersome Sharp (R) VX=2128R calculator -- but a feature that would be welcome on ANY calculator!), and a "live" battery, (you know -- an"AA" battery, or even two --which can easily be replaced.  Like they used to have when calculators first came out?)Oh, oh...wait a minute!  I see that Canon ALSO has, (or had), another model that looks ALMOST like this one does, but which has, as a model number, LS-85H 4050A001AA!  Looking at the description of it....YES!  It has a live battery!  AA!  Sadly, there was only one of these for sale......and, yes....this reviewer has done what the vast majority of people would do under the same circumstances....grab it!  Hopefully, Canon will produce more of this "AA" powered portable calculator....as will all other calculator manufacturers!  Replacable lithium batteries are just NOT easy to replace!  (I see that Canon DOES have a larger, 12-digit "AA" powered calculator, still on sale! -- Canon 7438A003AA).  It got one 3 star review....but if I wanted a larger, 12-digit calculator which uses a "AA" battery, I'd try this one for sure.Anyway, the Canon LS-85H, which is the main calculator being reviewed here, is a good, basic, little machine, with size, keys, and basic features, that feel, and respond, "just right".  Great for "Goldilocks", or anyone else you know -- even yourself!I love it!  The first one burst at the seam 2 weeks into it, but I emailed Fellowes and they sent me a replacement.  The texture of it is great - like soft shark skin or something.UPDATE: After a couple of weeks my opinion of this has dropped. The only good thing is that it has the same nylon covering as the original version. But the gel (or whatever they use now, it used to be gel) feels as hard as a rock and is really unpleasant to use. I thought I could live with the thinner padding but this is really really unpleasant to use.This isn't a worthless wrist rest but I'm giving it one star because Fellowes shouldn't be selling this under the same product ID (down to the model number) when it's significatnly different.It is significantly shallower (in terms of thickness) and hence doesn't offer nearly as much padding. It's also shallower front to back.This isn't a bad wrist rest (and they are much cheaper now: I paid roughly $13 for this compared to $18 4 years ago for the same product ID), but they are not in any way the previous generation.Some people might consider this a better product as they make not like the height of the earlier ones.Fellowes 91737 Gel Wrist Rest - Graphite/PlatinumThis wrist rest is very comfortable and it is soft and now my wrists have no more pain. The only complaint is when you take the wrist rest out of thee package it has a terrible odor and  it take a few days to go away, if you do not mind the smell it is a great wrist rest. I have owned it for 3 days and the smell is still there but the smell us much less, so I have decided to keep it.Thanks to a severe flare-up of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, I found myself in a lot of pain after a day of typing.  I finally broke down and bought wrist wrests for both my keyboard and my trackball, and I'm glad I did even though both took some major getting used to.  The keyboard rest is great in most respects, but for me it has two drawbacks:  It could be a bit longer, and it pushes the top of my keybard up under my desk (I have a pull-out shelf arrangement.)  Neither is the fault of Fellowes necessarily, and I mention it only to alert anyone who has a very wide or deep keyboard to these possible (minor) problems. I do find, however, that the rest isn't quite high enough for me to avoid some stressing of my wrists.On the plus side, it's got a backing that's so extremely non-skid that you have to lift it up to move it.  And the gel is loads of fun to play with while you're thinking.  I find myself pinching and poking it, and wondering how long it can take that sort of punishment before it breaks or tears.  I don't recommend this sort of behavior, but if you're prone to it, this might well give some scope to your nervous figets.Busted open the second day.  Too much weight on it or a crappy product?  Maybe just a flawed item in the mass distribution?  Whatever the reason, it busted open (cool to see the gel stuff though :)  Won't buy ever again, though.It works smoothly in the labeler and the backing is easy to remove. The drawback is that it doesn't stick very well to hard plastic surfaces or in cold temperatures. I wanted to label some oversize plastic storage bags in my garage, but they fell right back off. They work best indoors, on non-slick surfaces.Not much to say here. This is the 1/2&#34; size and I order a smaller size by mistake. (My own fault!!!) This is a perfect size for what I normally use this tape for and it's just as good as the 1/4&#34; size. The only problem I've run into on the this tape is being able to peel the back off the tape so I can stick it on a surface. I don't have long finger nails so it's hard sometime to get the backing off and instead of the tab the old plastic style tape used to give you to get ahold of the backing these newer tapes make you peel the label off from a cut down the middle and for me that's a bit hard. Otherwise no complains.I have been using Dymo labelers since the 1970's. They have changed a bit over the years. Now everything is electronic and computerized to some degree. Well, these labels are perfect for any application that requires identification. I highly recommend these labels because they break open in the middle from the rear, making them a "snap" to apply.I only wish the label maker itself had better directions on how to install and set up for the various widths of tape available.  But that is no fault of the replacement tape itself.  The lengthwise split in the backing makes removal of the backing VERY easy.  Additionally, it allows the user to stick the label on across only one half of the label first to make sure it's straight and get out any bubbles or creases - then remove the other half of the backing to smooth the label on the rest of the way.  Very good design.Great tape but hard to find.  There are no local retailers selling this product.  Was informed that due to new designs this tape not selling enough to carry on local shelves.  Thank heavens for Amazon.  Wasn't looking forward to having to buy a new label maker just because of obslesence.This was exactly what I had ordered . . . they were set at a great price and with my prime account the value is unbeatable :)A simple cartridge for your Dymo printer that prints black letters on white background. It is 1/2 inch wide and 23 feet long. I like the spilt back that is easy to peel off so you can stick the label quickly.  The Amazon price is very good as it is cheaper with free delivery than our local stores.Although my ordering of this product was totally accidental I decided to keep it since it is such a wonderful product.  I just will not run out of tape for quite a while.  I would highly recommend this product and remember the most expensive label makers are not necessarily the best.2-16-2012I did not open this product right away but when I did I found the incorrect item had been sent not just by one company but two; neither of which are Amazon.com.  I have actually stopped doing business with one company because they would not allow me to return the item.Yeah, it prints just great?!?  It's 4 stars only because I do think it's a touch expensive for printed words on sticky tape, but I'm also not labeling my entire house because... hello... I'm not a weirdo like that.  Just would like my husband to NOT use my back up hard drive.This labeling tape is pretty good, and it is darn near impossible to screw it up: drop it into the label machine, type up your label(s), have it print, then peel off the backing and apply.  I actually love these labels vs. what I have used in the past as it is truly a print, peel, and stick type of label with no mess and crisp, professional-looking fonts.  This tape is also much better than the tape that originally came with the machine as this tape is much longer and will last for a lot more labels.To top everything else off as I type this review, I saved a little over $6 as the price I paid on Amazon was $13.59 vs. $19.99 for the same exact roll at the Office Depot down the street.It arrived right on time. We used it right away & would order again. The cost per labrl is inexpensive.I love my DYMO label machine and have multiple choices of color tapes is perfect for all my various needs.The DYMO D1 labeling tape fit my Dymo Labelmanager Pnp Printer perfectly.  I like the looks of the labels and so far they stick very well in the applications I have found for them.  The tape seems a bit pricy, but not out of line with any other label maker tape.My labeling isn't extensive. I'm not cutting labels every day. But when I do I want to make neat labels that stay. Dymo labeling takes does it in a way very easy to use, is economical and stays put. The back peels off easily and application is nice. If I peel them off they come off clean (so far) without adhesive left behind.Works fine. No problems. Same as the tape that came with the printer but much longer. Easy to peel. Most importantly Amazon's price is six dollars less then my local box store. Now that deserves five stars!The tape is clean looking, prints up nice & stays where you put it. I use it on anything that I want to put the name on. For one spice jars. Files etc.Double check that this is the size you need.I might have gotten other labels for less money, but I must say that these labels have performed flawlessly. I could not take the chance of labels coming off large envelopes, so I paid the premium price.I use these all the time and the value is wonderful as is the convenience of the printer. I use the labels for both business and personalsimply very similar to the one that cost 5 times more! does what it suppose to do for much much less.Using for my business labels...loving this larger size for that purpose.  Lasting a long time too so that's awesome too.I use these labels continuously for shipping Amazon Marketplace items. I never have any feed issues and the consistency of the paper and print are very consistent.  The adhesive on these is very good and will permanently stick on packages, even on top of packaging tape. I would fully recommend this product for anyone wanting to print address labels as well as address labels with return & address on all one, or any other need for larger labels.Nice mouse pad in fire engine red.  since I'm an ex-field artillery officer, I love it too much GI.Gunner  April, 2014It is a basic mouse pad, no frills, just what is expected from a basic model.  Would be nice with a bit more friction to the base of the pad, it will tend to slip around if motivated by the user.I don't have anything bad to say, it works well, it does what it is supposed to, but it is a mouse pad. Enough said.Just the right size for a smaller desk and a bluetooth mouse to sit beside the kid's laptop. Brilliant red. Really good price and saved getting out in the crowds to buy a smaller item. Love the "add-on" feature, but shipping with Prime is free anyway! Bought a few while I was at it, good price, excellent quality.For the price alone I gave this four stars. It is basic old fashioned soft foam with a knit fabric top. The best thing about this pad is the beautiful red color (which is why I ordered it) so if you care about that I recommend it.  If you have an older mouse I think this pad will be fine, but for my optical Logitech M305 the soft material creates a bit of drag, it performs better with the denser, thinner foam and smoother plastic type top.  I have found a good use for it, however, when I travel with my laptop and don't have a table or place to use the mouse. I cut it in half, placing the half on the bottom flat part of my laptop, the softer foam of this pad stays in place better on the laptop.Worth the price I paid for it. Have definitely had and used better mouse pads but this one is not bad at all.The color is almost exactly as shown on the amazon.com site. I thought by the description it would be thicker, but it is better than the free one I got at the bank, yet not the old heavy neoprene style. Still, it does what it needs to do and is so pliable I can fold it and put it in a purse.Lasted only about a month before the edges started coming apart.  After 2 months, it was totally dirty and had to be trashed.  Worst mouse pad I've ever used and that counts the free ones I get at conventions.This mouse pad works great with my optical mouse. It isn't thick and bulky nor is it a slippery vinyl pad. It's the perfect size to sit next to my keyboard along with my bead-filled wrist cushion. It is a COMFORTABLE mouse pad covered with a soft  polyester fabric attached to a non-skid sponge rubber base. The texture provides good control for my mouse. For me, it's the perfect mouse pad, it's a nice color, and the price is right, too!Thiner than any other mouse pad I have bought, but holding up ok so far after 6 months. Pretty cheap price online.Should I be complaining about something that was less than a dollar?Yes, absolutely.The top layer of material, the red layer, is coming off from both the top and bottom of the muse pad after about a week's worth of normal use. The adhesive or bonding process isn't holding the two layers together.The size of the mouse pad is very good.It tends to slide around on my desk with very little effort.Waste of time with this mouse pad. Surprised at the lack of quality from Belkin.This mousepad is very thin and it is a bit clumsy to move around but the product infoon the product page says the top is made of durable polyester, so it might bedurable enough to buy.IT IS JUST SIMPLE MOUSE PAD CAN USE WITH ALL TYPE OF MOUSE.I AM OK WITH IT NO PROBLEM AT ALLBought this for my wife's red laptop.  It matches the computer and it works fine as a mousepad.  Nuff said!This little laminator is super easy to use. Just plug it in, turn it on, and wait for it to warm up. When it is warmed up, it beeps and a light comes on. You are now ready to laminate your cards. This little machine is durable, user friendly, and super easy! I highly recommend this to anyone who wants a quality machine for a decent price.This was delivered without the starter pack and without the carrier. Had no way to try it out. Returned to sender.We purchased this Fellowes Laminator to produce high quality durable laminate tags for our personal sports bags, gun cases and suitcases. This laminator works flawlessly and produces very professional looking laminate tags.I love this little unit. Slim, trim,portable quiet and does the job fast and effectively. I've been laminating EVERYTHING and then some. Laminated proof of insurance certificate, Registrations for cars, boats, motorcycles and waverunners, Medication List & Physicians List cards ( I typed a list of our medications and our doctors names and phone on a business card so I have it handy in case of emergency or filling out forms) Old photos, ID cards, newspaper clippings, prayer cards ( the ones you get from funerals), anything that would be beneficial to protect, I laminated.  It takes just SECONDS to do, and it comes out perfectly every time. Just picked up more business size laminating pouches from my local office supply, and I'm ready for more!For small laminating jobs this is a must. Why spend money and time going to Staples, Office Depot etc. when you can do this job yourself.We bought two of these a year ago. One to have just in case the other gave out. in one year of daily use we still have not had to open the box of the second machine. Like i said we use this thing daily. great product.This is a very cute machine perfect to laminate credit card size documents. Works great and excellent buy. I do recommend for small scale projects.There isn't much one can say about a black mouse pad. The vendor shipped it on time and in adequate packaging. It works well, measuring 8 inches by nine inches and about one-eighth of an inch thick. I have washed it once and it looks like it did when it was new... a very nice, if under-appreciated, mouse pad.I wanted a thin full size mouse pad for traveling. Something that is light weight, fits into a carry bag without taking up a bunch of space, I can fold it, roll it up or whatever and this baby fills my needs exactly. Plus, the mouse glides easily. I can also use it to set a hot cup of coffee on it while sitting at someone else's fine desk. Perfect for me.Great for the money. We like it and the mouse behaves well on it. Small, super lightweight, but rubber back keeps it from moving.Kind of smaller than I would haver preferred, but it does the job. I am getting to the point that I favor the rather larger takes on mouse pads, this one works and seems sturdy enough. 4 Stars.The pad is sort of OK - it's much smaller and thinner than advertised. I would say this is roughly the equivalent of the 79-cent mouse pads I can get at my local dollar store.The product description says the size is 9x8The technical details say the size is 9.5x8The size shipped to me is actually 9x7.75I guess it's kind of a quibble, but the pad I received is smaller than what was advertised.  It's also less than 1/8" thick as well.And, no, I wouldn't buy another.This mousepad has a smooth surface and works great with my mouse. It's nothing fancy but it works and the price is right.I like this mouse pad a lot. It is a very soft fabric that clings to the table, so my mouse doesn't move around much. It has no visible logos on it. I think that's also nice because I find logos can be really distracting. It is a good value at under $4. I would buy this again.  Just attach this add on item to your shopping cart of over $25. I am thinking of getting another one actually.I purchased this mouse pad for playing Starcraft 2 and it works just fine as it provides smooth operation with an Anker Lazer Gaming Mouse.  The mouse pad doesn't move around at all on my desk during frantic game playing and is a good size.  The price of $2.99 (as an adder) can't be beat even though I'm curious as to how long it will last compared to more expensive ones.I was hesitant to buy this after seeing the mixed reviews, but since it was relatively cheap, I decided to try it out. It came packaged with a stiff cardboard backing, so it was flat and didn't have any curling issues some other mousepads have. People have complained that the mousepad was too thin, but on my desk that is not an issue and I actually like how close to the table it lies as opposed to have a thick slab of a mousepad on my desk. I hold my mouse in a claw grip which means I don't put a lot of weight on it, so I haven't noticed any friction issues, but when I switch over to a palm grip (putting the whole hand on the mouse so it does get heavier) I do notice that there is a noticeable amount of friction between the mouse (amazonbasics 3-button mouse) and the mousepad. I am a tad concerned that the cloth portion might fray off of the mousepad, but only time can tell. After a significant amount of usage I'll post an update.I am reordering these mouse pads becuase they are great and simple.  I have purchased about 4 of these so far and love them.We've moved on from the thick mousepads of yesterday and graduated to what's more functional-- thin. You don't hit the edge of the wall on this, and it works great with optical mice. Many thing mouse pads are plastic top and cause issues with optical mice.A good price and works as expected.With the heavy wear that I give a mouse pad, I found that often I would have trouble getting the cursor precisely where I wanted.  Additionally I found it necessary to click several times to get my computer to react.  I had no idea that mouse pads varied in quality, sensitivity and drag.This fellow mouse pad is excellent.  The surface lets the mouse move freely with little drag and I am able to control the cursor.  The trouble with the sensitivity of the "click" was cured with a better mouse.I recommend the fellows mouse pad.  It meets all my requirements.This pad is soft and is this, it's the perfect mouse pad.  The top is fabric but that's great the mouse always works on this.Packaging says that the mouse pad is 50% pre-consumer recycled content, and that the packaging card is 100% post-consumer recycled material.Seems like a decent mouse pad and it'll fit my needs. I have knocked off one star because the pad is black and my other black Fellows mouse pads have-- over time-- become dirty with oil and dusk from hands and fingers. You therefore need to wash them frequently. I don't mean to slight a product because of it's color, but this pad should be available in grey or dark grey.It's a nice, basic mousepad that does the job.  I take it with me on business trips because I prefer using a small mouse with my laptop instead of the fingerpad.  This mousepad is nonslip and durable.the hard plastic back allows me to use the mouse anywhere, couch, leg, arm chair... happy. the little wrist pad is nice as well.We love these and our on our 2nd set of two of these. They last a few years and are good quality. The traction is great, easy use, small but not too small to navigate, and easy on the wrist.TFellowes Gel Mouse Rest and Pad (Sapphire Color)his mouse pad is great, it's wrist pad is just wonderful.  I have arthritis I do not have anymore pain.  I would definitely recommend this item.It works as expected - wonderfully!  I am no going to purchase an ergonomic keyboard and mouse!  The only thing is when I play online games, I have to turn the mouse rest with the wrist rest to the left in order to play appropriately - but I am very happy with the purchase.  Oh, and if you always have had issues with the mouse falling or slipping off of the mouse rest - it will not occur ever again with this purchase!!!!Thank you Amazon!If you spend long hours at your computer this mouse pad will make things a little more bearable.  Very well made. And I found I could reverse it,  front to back, and use it when my wrists were really tired.I don't think you can go wrong with this pad. Well worth the money.Perfect grasping of optical gaming mouse for great dpi sensing.  Also the gel wrest is highly recommended to help curb carpal tunnel syndrome, as it lifts the wrist during repetitive motion.  It might seem a little hard on the wrist at first, but that becomes moot soon enough.Great toner for my work printer.It sure was nice to get the toner cartridge good for 6000 pages rather than 3000 and the same price...goes down as a no brainer!!It's been exactly 2 years (as Amazon.com reminded me) since I last purchased this toner.  (I just reordered.)  I use reams of paper in my work, hence lots of ink, as well.  Never a problem, excellent copy.  I recommend this product highly.I bought it here it was supposed to be NEW and Genuine.But I got an opened unit, NO seal, NO yellow cover, NO instructions, NO orig box, it was just wrapped hastily in bubble wrap (small bubbles single layer) and put in an already used amazon box with cracks.  Upon inspection, the roller was dusty and had hair on it!I left a poor review for the seller, but he begged me to delete the review and for shipping refund. If anything I should have returned the item but I needed to use it.  Upon use it leaked all over the place, I had to spend a long time maintaining the unit and wiping with dry (not wet) paper towels.  It worked for a day and then slowly it leaked all over again!  The fax came in all totally smudged with ink. I thought my machine was old and had a tech come over to look, We replaced the toner and it worked fine, WTH?! I pay good money for bad crap, never again! $65 here vs $99 @ Office Depot, but you get what you pay for!this looks like it's the real thing - Brother made - I have been burned buy knock offs - which don't work or work poorly - thanks Amazon for not selling crapThe HP color printer cartridge prints the colors it is supposed to and is fairly crisp.Long-lasting output, vivid color on multipurpose paper xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx  xxxxxx  xxx  xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxx  xxxxxWhat can you say about ink cartridges.  Best value for the money when they are no longer being sold at normal outlets.These inks are great and long lasting. I have been using these on HP3915 printer. I don't use the printer much, and replace them once every year. No smudges/marks and well designed. I have been using HP printers and inks since 1999. Definitely recommend! The reason for 4 stars is it is expensive. The quality is good.A good ink with free shipping availability. I buy ink only with original printer manufacturer brand.I never really like matte inkjet papers or for traditional photo papers either. But I decided to give this a try for a reason that escapes me now. But it was a good  idea. I love this paper. It is matte without too much of a rough texture and then tones are fantastic.MATTE WAS MY PREFERENCE IN TRADITIONAL PHOTOGRAPHY:It has always been my preference to have pictures done on a matte medium.  While using traditional pictures especially if you like I did switched to the APS format, you could no longer get a matte finish.  Since I have gone digital, the only papers, that I have seen have been glossy, so this was a pleasant surprise.A CO-WORKER WHO IS ALSO A PROFESSIONAL PHOTOGRAPHER, INTRODUCED ME TO THIS PAPER:Knowing I used many reams of paper in glossy prints but really liked matte, a co-worker told me of this matte finish ink jet paper and showed me a photo he had done.  Wow!  He had the Epson 890 like I did, so I had to run out and get some of this amazing paper.  His daughter in the photo, was wearing a red dress and it was amazing in depth of color.MY TEST SHOTS WERE PHENOMENAL:I was not dissappointed in the results. Though I have used it only on a couple of shots (I consider my test shots), I was amazed at the crispness of the photo.  Only time will tell how well it lasts.  I plan to subject some to the ultimate test (for me) hung on my office wall without a frame.  I'll write back and tell you how it did.NO GLARE MEANS THE PICTURE JUMPS RIGHT OUT AT YOU:What I particularly like about matte pictures is the lack of glare.  You don't have to get the right angle to view it. Also there is almost a 3D effect since you don't see the surface of the paper to make it flat.  That is really nice.MATTE IS CHEAPER THAN GLOSSY:Matte paper at 50 pages per sheet cost also about the same of 20 sheets of glossy paper.. That too is a good thing.I've used Epson's Premium Glossy, Colorlife and Heavyweight Matte.  The Matte is far cheaper and gives beautiful results.  I've actually found that I like the Matte best for framing.  It has a less reflective surface and looks more 'arty' than photographic. But I wouldn't recommend it for architectural, detailed photographs.  A good benefit of both the Matte and Colorlife is that they have the longest rated life without fading of any paper for use with Epson's dye based printers.Epson makes great printer papers.  I use Epson's matte paper almost as much as the regular inkjet paper.  This paper is made for color presentation and graphic.  I print out my portfolio and sample work with matte paper because it is relatively cheap to the high quality printout.  I use the Epson 820 and the color print matches the monitor colors (98%) almost perfect.For photo prints it is fine, but photos are simultaneous with glossy texture.  If you like glossy photo then this is not the photo paper you would get.  The colors do not jump at you nor have sharp deferential qualities that glossy can produce.  Printing plain texts without color might be too wasteful (costly) for matte paper.  I considered Epson the best in paper qualities over Canon, HP, Kodak and others for the quality/price.  I have switched to the Canon i960 and am still using Epson's paper.  It is that versatile.  I tend to use the harder to find Epson double-side matte paper.When I want a matte paper that is lighter weight than the really heavy photo papers but heavier than the standard grade presentation paper, this is what I use. It produces photos that are crisp and vibrant. There is a lighter version of this, the Epson Presentation Paper, Matte. It produces exactly the same quality prints if you want an even lighter paper than this. I have both versions, this one is 44 lb, the lighter weight version is 27 lb.If you are doing something that requires a little more stiffness to your project, this would work great. If you just need great quality prints on a fairly light paper, go with the 27 lb version.One final note, these are NOT for two sided printing. The back side is a darker shade, and does not have the smooth finish. If you print on the back by mistake it will not turn out well. If I'm working in dim lighting I need to hold a back against a front so I can tell the difference for when I load my printer.I use this paper to print out the original copies of my association newsletter. It makes VERY clear original prints, which then are used to make color copies for our members. Much better than printing on regular inkjet paper. Also, I use it for printing pictures taken in the classroom. The students can cut and mount their pictures when doing writing projects.This is a great presentation paper. Prints on very nice, the color are good and sharp. Usable for many uses. Just make sure your printer is set right.We have used this paper to make brochures for a Real Estate Business.  It does the job well and have not experienced any problems.I have been using this product since its inception and it is perfect for my needsI is a of a heavy enough weight to print fine art photos, yet not so thick my new fancy printer will havea hissy fit over.The colors or black and white look gorgeous on this and they dry very quickly unlike with the glossy kind.when I need to print up some ad material that will be folded these work well.Overall a great product for business or personal use.Highly recommendOnce I set the (Epson Workforce 845) printer to "best photo" quality, it worked well and got intense colors. However, laying down that much ink on the paper made the paper crinkle somewhat from all the liquid.I bought this as an alternative to high priced Canon 13X19 matte paper.  I do a lot of small signs/posters and the paper cost of the Canon stuff was getting prohibitive.  The quality of this paper is OK, heavier than standard paper, and with a smooth finish to make inkjet printing look good.  The thing is, I cut down the price per piece, by also using a lot of white space, from over $2 apiece to about .50, without any real loss of impact.Do not attempt to print photos on this paper, saturated business graphics look good, your vacation shots will not.For the price, give it a try for graphics.I was very happy with this paper.My only issue is you have to be smart enough (which I wasn't ) to figure out which side to print on. One side is white, the other is off-white. If you print on the wrong side it doesn't come out well.Good quality prints at a very good price. Paper strength as disappointing but the images were vivid, but not the best photo qualityI am using a Pro 9000 Mark II and this paper is wonderful for presenting projects that do not require photo paper. I would recommend this to any graphic designer looking to minimize their footprint while not sacrificing the quality of their work. Beautiful prints on plain paper setting with high clarity.Make sure you see which side of the paper you are printing on. It will make a difference in the outcome as this is a one sided presentation paper. The other side has a yellowish tint to it!I use it before printing a photo for a proof. And also to make shooting targets. It prints crystal clear. The price was right. I keep it around for stock for my shop too.This is great for my purposes. I wanted paper that was lighter weight than the heavier matte papers, but I still wanted my photos to be crisp and vibrant. I am doing fliers with photos, and this paper is absolutely perfect! This is the Presentation Paper, Matte, and it prints EXACTLY like the 'Premium' (heavyweight) version. I have both versions, and I love both, but sometimes I don't want or need the weight or expense of the heavier papers. This one is 27 lb, the premium version is 44 lb. Both are great quality, and prints look exactly the same on both. The only difference is the weight.One final note, these are NOT for two sided printing. The back side is a darker shade, and does not have the smooth finish. If you print on the back by mistake it will not turn out well. If I'm working in dim lighting I need to hold a back against a front so I can tell the difference for when I load my printer.I bought these by mistake ... must have been distracted, I thought I was buying photocopy paper. Anyway, I kept them and i'm sure they will come in handly for something in the future. They seem to be of good quality. If you are looking for Matte Presentation Paper, you will probably be happy with this product.Really nice paper. Has good color and sharp words. Works great for pamphlets and many other uses. Be sure you printer is set wright for this paper and the results are great.I bought these from Ink Express (R S I Inc.)here on amazon. They appear to be OEM canon cartridges but they are not in a blister pack as illustrated on amazon, just 2 cartridges in a little plain brown box with an Ink Express label. Each cartridge has its plastic wrapper intact. I installed the first one in my printer. Hopefully it will be fine.I only use genuine canon cartridges so I would feel better if they came in the canon blister pack as shown on amazon but I decided not to return them. I see that today they are being offered by another seller and Ink Express does not have any more for sale. It makes me wonder where these come from or how long they have been sitting around.I had picked up another canon cartridge from a well-known online auction site and it had very old canon labeling. I contacted canon and they said the cartridges do not become outdated and it was safe to use. However it lasted a lot shorter than my ink tanks usually do. Just a few words to the wise.it's ink...from canon.  Works perfectly as it is intended.Please don't buy and review things and be stupid about them.  Ie., if you don't want to spend money for ink...don't buy printers.  We all know how much inks costs...or relatively so.I love buying the canon 4 packs when I start running out of ink.I bought the pack when my magenta indicator was active and just waited.  Then it seemed like cyan followed a short while later, and then yellow and black are still waiting to join the group ;).Canon products are the best, from camcorders, cameras, scanners, printers and ink.  I have the Canon HV20, CanoScan5000f, and Canon i850.These cartridges always worked perfectly in my Pixma 5000 photo printer.  This printer finally died because of rough handling during a move.  If it hadn't been dropped, it would still be going strong today!  The most durable and reliable printer I have ever owned.  Tried third party cartridges, but they were terrible.  Always stick with the Canon cartridges and your printer will last longer and print perfectly.The ink tank arrived on time and in good condition. It prints well even on the lowest-quality printer setting (no streaks, stray marks, etc.). It is easy to install and to replace when necessary.These inks are inexpensive and a great value for your dollar.  Only buy authentic ink as some generic inks will smudge or damage your printer.  I have used Canon brand ink for years and have nothing but satisfaction for them.  Quality is consistent and is a trusted brand worldwide.I have an old Canon i550 which uses the BCI-3e ink cartridges. FYI, should Canon discontinue this 4-color 3e series, I found BCI-6 cartridges (BCI-6C-6M-6Y) fits and works great without any problem. Thank you Amazon, for providing the inkjet replacement information check list.I am always wary of ordering ink for my printer online. According to reviews, what is shown is not always what is received. These were factory sealed exactly as shown in the picture, original Canon. Very happy.I have been using Canon inks and printers for years and awhile back, I decided to try out some of those generic ink tanks and ink kits (you know, the ones with the syringes?). Both ruined my printer, after awhile. They seem to work initially, but you can tell the colors are off. Sure, the generic inks are so much cheaper, but the costs of getting a new printer are going to make up for those few $ you saved on ink. Trust me on this one, buy Canon OEM cartridges!We all know by now that printer manufacturers made 90% of their money on ink. In fact, I think I just saw a WSJ review that said that 60% of all HP profits came from ink. I believe it - even if I misquoted it. Whether Canon or HP, this stuff is expensive, especially if you print photographs, and especially if they're 8x10s. (Add another 50 a sheet for the Canon glossy paper!) As careful as I am in selecting such photos, I replace the black cartridge about once a month; the cyan, yellow, etc. about every 3 months.Quality is great, as good as HP. (Others have been inconsistent.) But the price is ridiculous especially since I return the empty cartridges, so I've spent $25 on maybe 4 ounces of ink. I'm seriously thinking of trying the refill services. New printers are cheap...I have had a Canon S630 for over a year now, and I love it. After having problems with Epson and HP printers, I tried the Canon and was astonished with the print quality. The only down side is I got my S630 before they came out with the larger format version, which I would have wanted. Certainly not Canon's fault there. I have printed 8x10s from a 2 megapixel Olympus digital camera, and was pleased with how close it came to 35mm for the price. Since 35mm has considerably more resolution than 2 megapixels, obviously there is a clear difference. However, this printer did a fine job of substituting for the One Hour Photo average picture taking level, and has saved me a ton of money.I also do not recommend generic or refill inks for printers, as I had an HP printer ruined by them. I prefer the separate tanks for each color as well, for the simple fact that they don't make you waste ink. I have gotten over 40 8x10s out of one set of ink tanks, but it varies widely with color saturation and picture content, so I don't think it is possible to give any accurate figures for usage. Another plus for Canon is that the print head is not a part of the ink cartridge, so you don't have to pay to replace that every time you replace ink tanks, unlike some other brands of printers. While there may be some value to that kind of system, Canon's system is less expensive to the user.The ink doesn't seem to dry out very fast with long periods of inactivity, although it is better for the printer to use it regularly. I also like the fact that the low ink warnings give enough time so that one can plan one's usage carefully to maximize what you have left and not run out of a color in the middle of a critical print.Much to my dismay, this more expensive branded ink works considerably better than the inexpensive stuff.  I've tried both -- the knock off brands tend to run a little more, and they also smudge when they get at all damp.  The Canon inks print more crisply and hold onto the paper better.For draft printing, the knockoffs are fine, but otherwise, go with the Canon inks.Although the cartridges look like genuine Canon, they did not come in the Canon packaging shown in the illustration---which I find worrisome.The price I paid ($27) I paid is the price of fresh genuine virgin Canon, not the price of a cheap refills, OEM, 3rd-party cartridges, counterfit cartridges, or out-of-date repackaged cartridges.Amazon promptly offered a full refund (if I ship the cartridges back), but that really doesn't solve the issue.I suggest contacting the seller and asking for assurance that the product is fresh virgin original Canon cartridges in original Canon packaging before purchasing.I love the canon Ink it works good and it does clog up your printers gives you beautiful photos I will never change this brand Thanks again amazon for another job well doneOur printer is listed on this package, however it is cleary the wrong cartridge.  Ours uses the 220 which is shorter.  Rather than trust the package check your cartridge prior to ordering.  The number is clearly visible.I really like this label maker. I also have another similar model. The only bad thing I have to say about this is the tapes are expensive and can be hard to find. This unit also comes with a shorter "starter" cartridge instead of a regular one. I couldn't find the black on white tape on Amazon.com (sold by Amazon.com), but unless you label a lot the tapes will probably last awhile. I also like the QWERTY keyboard on this unit.UPDATE 2008-12-30:Batteries: I just bought a PT-80. The PT-65 uses 6 AA batteries while the PT-80 only uses 4 AAA batteries. I think the 6 AA battery requirement for the PT-65 is a bit much, especially if you don't print that many labels (like me). One or two of the batteries (Rayovac Alkaline) in my PT-65 ended up leaking.Another minor issue may be the amount of blank tape at each end of the label seems a but wasteful and excessive.I think I will like my new PT-80 even more, so check into that model.I purchased this little machine about 10 years ago. I really needed one for a few quick labels. It was cheap and since I didn't think I would be using it for a long term I would try it. I did buy several replacement tapes at the time ( I was positive I would not be able to get any in 6 months) Well it is at least 10 years, The machine works as well as it did new and labels are still available. If I had a need for one I would not hesitate spending what they are asking for this one. A trick I've learned  is to run the front of the tape gently across your thumb and a dull knife then flip the label over and with a bit more pressure run the tape on the paper side. Like curling ribbon, but not as much pressure. It works like magic. Any stiff, smooth, straight edge will do. If you are in need of one of these I highly recommend this one. I have gone through about 25 tapes, the cutter still works like it is supposed to. I'm not sure how many labels you can get out of a refill but they seem to last forever. I just popped the last one in my machine, so I am replacing my stock. I will only buy 2 this time because they seem to be available. I will look to brother the next time I need a machine that they make. I am no longer angry about the 6 month old typewriter I couldn't get a ribbon for 30 years ago lol.I bought this model over others mainly because of its low price (I paid $10 bucks with no rebate hassles).  It turned out to be a decent buy but it becomes obvious that the low inital price will eventually be offset by the high price of label cartridges.*** Plus Points Include ***- Easy to use though you will have to read the short manual to understand how to change the font, print size, etc.- Decent size that is portable yet still highly usable- Good quality print with a reasonable amount of fonts and borders- Replacement cartridges have a variety of colored labels to chose from.*** Negative points are: ***- It does not take laminated labels so the labels are for indoor use only.- The labels are always printed with a huge gap at the beginning and end so it wastes a lot of label space (and thus it eats up label cartridges).- The batteries are a real pain to remove because they are staggered on top of each other- If you print 2 line lables you cannot change the fonts or size- As other users have mentioned, it is not easy to separate the label from its backing.All in all this is not a bad label maker for people who need something cheap and easy for the occasional label or 2 but if you are obsessive-compulsive or need to print a ton of labels you are probably better off spending a few bucks more on something that wastes less of its label cartridge.This little baby works great for labeling just about anything.  The interface is intuitive and easy to use, the print options are pretty good for an inexpensive machine, and print quality is superb.  The only thing keeping this from garnering 5 stars is the printed label backing.  Although it sticks great to just about anything, it can sometimes be a challenge to remove the backing from the tape.I love my label-maker and can't imagine life without it. I label Rubbermaid totes, charging cables, A/V equipment, boxes, leftovers for the freezer, etc...and the tape always sticks to everything. The only thing I don't like is the wasted space before and after the printed text, but it's not enough to keep me from giving this baby five stars.I love the QWERTY keyboard. There's enough variety in printing (sizes, special characters, outlines, etc.) to keep things interesting, and it's fairly easy to understand without having to resort to the instructions each time. That said, I'm fairly bland with it and pretty much use one or two main settings all the time.I have had this labeller for several years, and never had the label tape bind up. The unit is easy to use--hitting the function keys allows you to change print size, and there is a cutter on the side to dispense the label when printed. The previous entry stays on the screen for printing multiple copies. It's a useful device for labeling food bags in the freezer, making file folder labels, and any number of things that I used to label with the old embossing type label tape. The batteries seem to last plenty long (it takes AA's.) No complaints here, priceworthy and works well.We owned another labeler made by Dymo and were not very happy with it.  The keys were laid out alphabetically rather than QWERTY style and typing felt unnatural.  We also could not find any store that carried blank label cartridges - even the store we bought it from (Best Buy) didn't.  We had to order them directly from the manufacturer and probably paid more than we needed to.Although the old labeler still works, we decided to purchase this one.  It is a much better product.  The keypad is easy to use and the unit has some great features built into it. I like the fact that you can change fonts, or frames  and can print on a variety of colors.  The labels seem to stick much better than the Dymo brand labels we used before.  They adhere to surfaces that I couldn't get cellophane tape to stick to. Almost every office supply or electronic store seems to sell the label cartridges in several colors and sizes.I only have two negative comments about this unit.  First, sometimes it is hard to peel the back off of the label.  You have to try to get your fingernail or similar object between the backing and the label and this is often difficult to do.  Second, it needs SIX AA batteries to run. If you print a lot of labels you're going to be buying a lot of batteries.  I wish that they could have designed it to run off of an AC power source also.Despite these negatives, I think that this is great product.  It works well, is compact, and is reasonably priced.My husband bought this so he could label his files at work (since even HE can't usually read his own writing). One day, he brought it home so he could print labels while watching TV. Silly man. I started using it to make labels, and he's never been able to get it away from me.In the kids' rooms, I used it to label toy shelves and drawers so that even my pre-schooler knew where to put away his clean clothes. That was almost a year ago, and the labels have stayed in place through countless grubby fingers grabbing at them, as well as countless times I've scrubbed away at the marks those grubby fingers leave.In the kitchen, I didn't stop at labeling cannisters or jars. I labeled drawers, shelves and cupboards, too! Now, neither my husband nor the kids have an excuse to avoid emptying the dishwasher, because they know where everything goes! As in the kids' rooms, the labels have stayed put and held up to repeated cleanings.In the guest room, where the lightswitch operates three separate lights and a ceiling fan, I labeled the switch plate so my guests don't have to waste time flipping switches to find the one they want to turn on or off. Numerous visitors have commented on how helpful this has been, particularly when they're groggy in the morning.Of course, it's been essential in the storage room where clearly-written labels have saved us hours of hunting around in boxes and bins. I even labeled spots on my husband's tool bench. Now when I borrow a pair of pliers or screwdriver he's no longer complaining that I don't return it to the right place.This product is sturdy, too. My 5-year-old has taken a turn printing up labels and yanking out the tape. Although the tape has jammed in there a few times when he's done this (and I'm fairly certain any label-maker's tape would do the same thing), it's been a cinch to get straightened out. It's even survived being dropped on the floor a number of times.I am impressed, and I'm also addicted to this thing. Naturally, my friends and family members all teased me over my addicition... until I gave them each one. Now they're addicts, too!The PT-65 has become a lifesaver in my workplace.  Since I work with Nortel phone systems, life can get pretty wild when you have a load of phones to punch down on blocks that go to different wings of a building.  I carry the PT-65 with me to new job sites and label each punch-down block so that I can easily keep track of what goes where.  Also, the labels look very professional when placed on folders in the office.Overall, this labeler is quite easy to use and very convenient to carry around from job to job.  I'm sure it works great with computers, filing systems, and even baseball card collections as well.This is a nice labeler.  I got it as a present more than a year ago and have found that it has so many uses.  I label everything with it.  I can choose different type styles and sizes.  I can underline and choose a frame.  I can even check the length of the label before I print it.The labels are waterproof.  I've labeled ice packs that I keep in the freezer and send to school with my kids.  I've also labeled food containers that end up in the dishwasher.  The labels do not come off when wet, not even in the dishwasher.There are so many uses for this labeler.  It's a great buy.Excellent product! This is one of the first electronic devices that gets my &quot;thumbs up!&quot; within the first day of using it! And it get addicting making labels, for this thing here, that thing there. Fun and easy!Excellent design, very comfortable to hold in your hand with a good weight/balance [not too heavy, not too light] and good size. The buttons are not too small and the arrangement of the buttons are easily accessible and easy to learn.Excellent accessories with different types of ink/tapes and sizes! Very good printout of labels, quick and no jamming! and easy to cut. Wonderful smoothness and professional look to the labels. Good stickiness to objects too [plastic, metal, leather, paper], waterproof as well.I would recommend this 100%, Brother's has created a product that is affordably cheap and easy to use, fun and reliable. Nothing to complain!Bic Pens: from plain (like these) to "fancy", they write, they write, they write -- they are inexpensive, seem to last a looong time, and create GREAT multiple copies because you press em as hard as you want and they write, they write, they write.Best little pen I ever had. Use em far more often than I use my Parkers (which I also love)36 pens with 2-day Amazon Prime delivery? Yes please! Seriously though, these are just what you expect: good old Bic ball point pens. Prices seem to vary on this product, so I'd suggest browsing through the various sizes/colors to find the current best deal.If your looking for cheap then this is what you need to get, If your looking for fancy and attractive this is not it for you.  I'm sure every one has used normal bic pens before, they are exactly the same as the one you normally used.  I personally don't mind  using them, I live with a few people in my house and my pens tend to get lost  quite often. They normal everyday pens.I have several friends who are servers at my favorite restaurant. They go through a lot of pens - customers take them, bussers toss them, they drop them, etc.  This package, as an 'add-on' item, cost under 10 cents per pen so I ordered two and took them in.  BIC pens are pretty reliable for taking orders and are cheap enough they don't mind putting them down with credit card receipts.Used to purchase pens from costco and sams club but they wouldn't write on paper when written on top of glass. these bic pens always work the best and the blue was just cheaper but is more vibrant color so works out well when signing paperworkI think we've all used these pens for thousands of years, or so it seems!  This is usually one product on which you can count, to not leak all over the place and still write nicely, and for a long time.  However, I noticed that they're now made in Mexico.  Why on earth?  Bic, you need to come back home to make these.  Other than that, highly recommend!Indeed, as another reviewer has stated, these pens have been around for almost ever.  There of course is a reason for this...actually several reasons.  First they are quite inexpensive.  Second, they actually write.  Third they are available anywhere. Forth, they do no leak.  They last quite a long time.  And finally, they are not unpleasant to write with.I substitute teach which means I can be in a 3rd grade class one day and in an advanced high school class the next...I never know.  I carry a very large canvas pouch with me stuffed with stuff.  I always carry at least two or three packs of these pens with me as invariably, sure as the sun rises, there will be at least one or two kids who forgot their pen or pencil (I always keep several packages of pencils too...but that is for another review).  I have also noted that some classes and some students will actually try to take advantage of a substitute teacher and their third favorite request the instant the bell rings is "can I go to my locker...I forgot my pen."  Ha...I have the little twerps! And I don't even have to be mean about it like I do with the endless bathroom and drink requests.Anyway, these pens work great.  They do not leak all over the place and smudge.  If the student forgets to return the pen...which often happens, I am not out a lot of money and they are less likely to steal them as they do not really look all that cool nor do they have a lot of whistles and bells on them.As an additional advantage, I do not mind writing short notes with them myself, and I am one of those people who are constantly misplacing pens all over the house and at my desk.  I have found that even I have trouble loosing these things if I buy them a dozen at a time.  Anyway, they write smoothly and get the job done.Like another reviewer here, I am not all that happy about these not being manufactured in this country anymore and think it is a shame...but what are you going to do?  I guess it is worth it if we can make the fat cats fatter. I will note that when the company changed the manufacturing location, to save money I presume, I certainly did not see the price of these things, cheap though they  may be, going down any, for us, the consumer.Be that as it may, I certainly can recommend these things.  They do what they were meant to do.Don BlankenshipThe OzarksWhat can one say about these pens? They're about the most basic pens imaginable. They have a plain, cylindrical body, a thoroughly unsophisticated plastic cap, and the whole assembly is the same color as the ink contained within. They won't win any beauty contests, but they do put ink on paper, and they do it cheaply. Isn't that what really counts at the end of the day?One minor complaint I have about these pens is that the caps tend to crack if you put them on tightly. Other than that, these are perfectly adequate and the price really can't be beat.I LOVE LOVE LOVE these! This is my Second Order of these which I have placed! When I find something that works as nice and well as These Do, I am a Very Happy Camper! These are really Good Quality Pens and they last! I have really gotten tired of purchasing pens that run out of ink, with very little use. I would recommend these pens to anyone who journals, does a lot of writing, or simply needs a pen that is Reliable and great to use! I would have rated these a TEN if there were more stars! Thanks BIC and AMAZON! These were a Great Deal and well worth purchasing!Good pens and the price is right. I don't like to pay an extreme price for pens but i expect them to work. These fill the bill nicely.You get what you pay for.  Cheap is cheap.  Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't.  But to hand out to clients that will not return, it's perfect, that was we don't lose our better pens.I got these for a steal on Amazon sometime after Thanksgiving. These BICs are my favorite pens to use, even if they aren't too fancy. Overall, I love these, and I will probably buy a million more of them in my lifetime.We all are familiar with the Bic round stic pens, with the white barrel, medium or fine points.  I decided to buy this 60 pack when I saw that the pens had a new design.  It says white barrel in the description, but I hoped to get this new color.  Luckily I did.  The pen now comes in a clear blue tinted barrel so you can see the ink inside, and it looks more interesting than the traditional white.  But, I think the pen would benefit a lot more if they added a grip to it.  It still feels about the same as the old barrels.They write the same as always, too.  Not as good as the Cristal pens, but decent.  The Cristal pens have a wider point or something, even though these are both labeled as medium points.  If you want a basic blue ballpoint, this is it.These were being offered when school was starting for most as an add on option that Amazon now offers with their sellers.  We got a great deal and a good amount of them when they were offered.  The spiral didn't unwind like some of lesser quality do.  We use these spirals for work, school and home use.What can i say it is a notebook with paper in it. It does what it is intended to do. I gave it 4 stars because i don't like red. Well thats not the notebooks fault it is mine. Maybe i am being picky, do you think?but it also has to be affordable.  We have order many of these notebooks to use as a journal for our clients to use.  it's a great product and will continue to order as needed.This purchase is such a no brainer.  Note that Amazon only lets you buy a total of three of these, but it can help you make the $25 free shipping threshold.  At present, these are going for 45 cents versus the 51 cents I paid.  You cannot purchase these in the grocery store for that price, which is where I usually get them.  I go through these notebooks regularly, using them for shopping lists and planning events.  Okay, I'm getting to the point that at times I have to write things down because I can't remember them otherwise.  You say, why not post its?  Yes, I use those too, but occasionally the project is much more than a post it can handle.  For instance, when I go away for one or two weeks, there are a number of things I have to remember to do during the seven days before I leave.  So, I dedicate a page for each day and write down the things that have to be done.  Similarly, Thanksgiving is coming up.  For the two weeks prior, I have a ton of things that need to be done before T Day, and then each day I check off the things as they are completed.  Never mind Christmas.  You get the idea.  I don't care about whether there is a particular quality to the paper or whether the perforation is perfect.  The pages are torn out as tasks are completed.  And yes, I have even given them to my grandkids for their school projects, with no complaints.it takes notes, uses standard paper and generally does what a notebook should. What more is there to say about a note book.I bought a whole case of these Mead spiral notebooks for my kids.  The pages are thin, they aren't perforated, but the price was right (back to school sales) and I'm not expecting much for school notebooks.  My biggest qualm is the wire spiral eventually getting tangled around the holes on the left edge.  It's not neat and pretty after a while and the covers don't sit well then.  They do start out looking nice and I'm not really complaining.The pages are wide-ruled, good for elementary school kids.  Both of my kids use them and they don't have any issues with them.For the price, surprisingly decent notebooks, arrived in just a few days (from MeadWestvaco), and no qualms with the paper quality etc. Will buy again whenever I need economical notebooks.i finally have a book that i write all my lyrics and poems :)  &#60;3  yippy its a great :)My notebook with a bluish-purple cover arrived within several days of placing the order. The price alone for this notebook is good, but when you consider free delivery, it's an even better deal. I always like having spare notebooks around in case I need notebook paper or a student needs paper. The paper is wide ruled for those who like that configuration. Pages aren't perforated for easy removal, but at this price point it can't be expected.This notebook has the SFI, certified sourcing emblem on the cover.I've ordered several of these Mead Spiral notebooks from Amazon. They are affordable and always ship quickly, arriving in pristine condition. Colors are variable. Nothing out of the ordinary here, just a notebook you could buy at a store, but it's nice to have it delivered without paying more rather than having to buy it at the store. Another advantage is that you can have them shipped in bulk. I tend to go through a lot of notebooks and I've been pleased with the service ordering through Amazon. I recommend it.The real deal.  This is the actual Scotch brand double stick tape.  The vendor sent it out quick.  Very pleased.Great tape that I've been using for years. Not sure what to say except its a great deal for the price and holds up incredibly well. We use it all the time around here for crafts, scrapbooking and more!Ordered this to secure my headphone ear pads. Works well, does the job. There is a protective leader for the first several inches. Tear that off and the rest of the tape is unbacked, double sided with adhesive.I bought the Scotch Double Sided Tape to put up posters. I'm very happy with how well it works. The adhesive on both sides of the tape is very strong, so the tape will hold very well.It is almost completely see-through despite being coated with adhesive on both sides of the tape. This makes it ideal on clear plastic where it should be almost invisible.The length of tape is only 250" (6.3 m) long, so these are pretty expensive! Apart from the price, the Scotch Double Sided Tape is perfect.I have been using this 2 sided-tape for longer than I'd like to admit.  It is a staple, go-to item with so many uses.I just barely missed out on Scotch's new mounting tape, which more readily can be taken off most surfaces without residue or remnants of its backing.This is essential, for any time you move or otherwise have a reason to take down something from your wall, it leaves a mess that you have to scrub with the abrasive side of a kitchen sponge.Having stated that objection, Scotch's 1/2" Mounting Tape has plenty of uses:  It is great for those stubborn posters that refuse to stay up when you refuse to mar your walls with thumb tacks.I've used this product (and other sizes as well) for putting up a simple dry erase board with a cardboard backing.  It gives me space to write calendar urgencies upon a wall in an affordable way.It does not (nor do the instructions imply that it does) work with heavy pictures or mounting other heavy wall objects.Seeing the improvements made for its newest addition, this old product version will do the trick, but the newest version is most desirable (particularly for landlords and perfectionistic homeowners) for changing or taking down mounted products.Cut to the chase . . . this product works well.  Only a little dab will do you.  If you use too much tape you will have a hard time trying to remove what you put up there on the wall etc.  You only need a small quantity to do a great job of holding something to a clean surface.  I highly recommend this and most all 3 M products.Perfect size for hanging lightweight objects. 1/2" wide and just 1/16" thick, this is ideal for office projects like securing whiteboards or wall-mounted file pockets (like these:Rubbermaid Three-Pocket File Folder Organizer, Plastic, 13 x 3.5 x 11.5 Inches, Clear (96050ROS).  No more cutting chunky doublestick tape down to size:  this is neat, clean, and easy.  Rated to hold up to 2 pounds.This mounting tape works very well to walls or smooth surfaces.It can hold posters, post cards and other not too heavy papers and decorations.Scotch is a good reputable name whose products are good quality and reliable.This tape is another fine dependable product.The other day I needed to mount a paper towel holder in my kitchen.  I have had a hard time in the past trying to drill into our kitchen cupboards, so I used this tape instead.  I was only able to use 2 small pieces about 1 inch each in length.  It has now been up all week!  I am impressed.  Most of the time I usually thing that tape is just tape and I've had mixed experiences with tape of this type. But, with this tape I am pleased!This stuff works really well.  I only put on things that I plan on leaving up for a long time/permanently - so unfortunately, I can't comment on stuff left up for longer than 6 months since I just got it ( maybe update later).  For temporary items, I use the temporary "command" strips from 3M which allows me to peel stuff off walls without damage.  This product is supposed to be permanent, so there is no guarantee it won't damage your walls.  I use it to hold a metal towel hook to wood drawer.This can come in handy for different home projects and decorating. For example, I decorated a huge bathroom mirror with small framed pictures using this double sided tape, it looked great. Perfect when you can't or don't want to ruin a wall with a nail.  I also decorated the ceramic tile backsplash in the kitchen with the same sort of small framed pictures.  The tape is not too hard to remove from the glass/mirror/tile surfaces but expect some difficulty when removing from painted walls.  A little sanding of the residue is needed.I have glassed and framed art on my walls that were mounted using this tape and have been holding fast for six years.  It is an excellent product that does exactly what it says.  Be aware that its use should be considered permanent.  I have not found anything that will removed the remnants of adhesive and foam from either the wall or the mounted item when I've re-located or removed whatever the tape is holding up.Use brand names for tape.  Do not skimp.I am a cheap skate but I offer this advice from experience.I used this product to hang large posters on my workplace walls for a party. It holds well even on textured surfaces and comes off cleanly.  Best of all, I was able to remove the foam tape from the posters without tearing them so I could store gem for use in hue future.Its tape!I haven't used this a lot yet, but, based on my fairly small sample of experience, this product is a lot stronger than other mounting tape I've tried.  We used it putting up posters at a fundraising event and it did an outstanding job - even on a brick wall.  It gripped the wall and the posters very well.  It didn't take a great deal of length to hold bulky and moderately heavy posters.  Pretty much exactly what you're looking for from a product like this.While the mounting of objects on walls is a great use for double-sided tape, its unintended uses are also very practical.Being able to "test-fit" components with this type of tape before final (glued) assembly is particularly handy. Just be aware that the tape can pull off the top surface of any "layered" material.You can attach a fairly heavy object anywhere you want on a smooth, strong surface. An open-end wrench from a "Model-T" is currently attached to my toolbox fascia, strictly for aesthetic purposes.Most often, I use it for securing small rubber feet/pads at the bottom of items that live on tabletops, as well as securing shims of wood, cork, plastic, cardboard, metal, rubber, etc. onto the bottom of uneven items.If you need to re-attach or re-orient an object that had a single-use, "peel-off" sticky surface originally applied, this tape is your friend. The most common usage in that category is the "deer whistles" re-attachment on my car's front bumper. I always seem to find them on the ground where I park. Take the time to remove any residual gunk with a Goo-Gone/Dissolve-it -like solvent, and then some alcohol to get rid of any oily film, first.Just appreciate that this tape is permanent in the sense that disassembling the pieces it connects may damage them. You need to "pry" things off very slowly and carefully. It is also almost structural at the scale of flimsy plastic components, which seems to describe most objects these days.There is another variant - "Heavy Duty" double-sided tape (colored red, rather than white) for more massive items and those that you'd prefer to not ever come loose. It works almost like an epoxy. I used some most recently for attaching a rubber/foam door seal (intended for a garage door's bottom edge) as a threshold on a tile floor - 1 year on and it's still holding.Also, don't throw the packaging away, since it lists the strength of the adhesive, which is very convenient when you want to calculate how much to use. 1" wide tape is also available.This product is an indispensable item in my toolbox/fabrication drawer. I don't use much, but even a small piece is oftentimes invaluable.Scotch is the brand I usually buy when looking for tapes.  I have bought the two sided tapes for years now, for both business and personal needs.  The early lesson I learned was to make doubly sure that you mount to a surface where you won't want to remove the item from later.  If you mount a picture to a painted wall, for example, and then remove it the paint will most likely comme off with the tape.  This tape here is clearly called "Permanent" for good reason.I use this tape for attaching to surfaces that are not smooth... like the dash of my car or the fabric on my cub wall...  so far it is a permanent hold and appears to want to stay that way.  But please keep in mind that this is a permanent adhesive.  Removal of this tape at best will leave a difficult to reove residue.  Mlre often it will damage the surface... permanet implies forever, so if you use it in that manner you will be satisfied.I perhaps have a strange use for this product. I have a size 9 1/2 foot, and it's wider than most shoes of that size at a 5E. Add to that, my size makes it difficult to tie shoes directly, so I tie them before I put them on, and use a shoe horn.  The problem is the tongue of the shoe can get pushed into the shoe, slipping it on this way, and then the fit is wrong.  I've tried to tie the strings to keep the tongue in place, but this had mixed benefits. I decided to try this two-sided tape, and it works great.  I cut about two, one inch pieces, put them on the top of the tongue, and stuck them to the shoe top from within.  The stick works pretty well and so I no longer have the problem.I believe the sticking power will also work in hanging some of my anime posters that tend to come down with regular tape.  I might try this on some hooks as well, but I believe 3M has a better product for that application.  This is not going to be much use for a carpet, windows, or larger applications, you don't get a lot of tape in the roll, and it's white, not clear, so unless hidden behind the use, you can see it.  All in all though a good product, I'll definately want to get some more.I remember learning, back in 1st or 2nd grade, how to make standard scotch tape in to double sided tape by just making a loop. That lesson is probably the most-used lesson from that time in my life and I still use that trick on a somewhat regular basis. Scotch Mounting Tape steps things up a couple of notches. Since receiving this tape I have used it to secure a large calendar to my desk, hand a couple of light pictures, and to hold display bottles in place at a chocolate fair.It's light, inexpensive, durable and is handy to have around.Easy to use mounting tape - easy to cut to exact size.  I've used it to mount my wireless router to the wall and it's been holding up for three months with no problems.  I'll update if it falls, but so far, so good.Used for the right applications, this is a great product.  I wouldn't use it for mounting anything where a nail or screw is the usual holder, though.  This is just great for very lightweight objects or for holding heavier objects steady (where the tape is not actually supporting the *weight* of the object).  For example, I have a heavy mirror mounted to my bedroom door by over-the-door hooks.  Every time the door was closed, the mirror would swing behind, clapping against the door when it stopped.  But by putting a square of Scotch's "mounting tape" behind each corner, the mirror stays firmly against the door (even with raucous kids running in and out).  The great thing about this tape is that the foam layer helps compensate for a small amount of surface irregularity on the object or mounting surface.The package directions specify to use four inches of tape for each half pound of object weight, to a maximum of two pounds.  For heavier applications, consider using Scotch'sexterior mounting tape, which is rated at being able to hold up to five pounds.For best adhesion and performance, really mash the tape in well, smoothing it all over, then apply very firm pressure against the mounted object over each point where you applied tape.  Consider cleaning the wall with alcohol before applying tape to remove any oily residue from household cooking (even if it's not in the kitchen).Works absolutely great for hanging all sorts of things on the wall. I'll be concerned if I have to remove it at a later period, but for now, everything I put up remains there. It's truly a a wonderful product, and great to have on hand.3M's Scotch is THE brand to look for all your mounting needs.  I've used their mounting sprays, "invisible" tape, and for commercial applications (mounting permanent signs) with their 3M VHB foam tape.  Each serves its unique purpose.For this tape, its ideal for posters, plaques, signs, and some lightweight picture frames.  When mounting an item, you can remove/reposition (for perfectionists like me, this is a huge plus!).  Let it sit for a while and it becomes more permanent.  Keep in mind that this is just foam tape, and not ideal for holding very heavy items.  3M recommends that the items you mount not exceed 2 lbs.  If you need to mount something heavier, and more permanent, consider 3M's VHB (very high bond) tape (which is also very expensive!), or silicone caulking (can be found at most home improvement stores).This is a useful item to have in the household drawer. Just don't expect it to hold anything on a wall other than very lightweight items (like paper). The adhesive just isn't very strong.This mounting tape (double-sided) is very strong. I was able to hang a mid-size picture frame or a clock using this and is still standing fine for more than a month now. However, be cautious about the paint - some paint layers can rip due to the weight. Depending on the paint and number of layers you have, you may have to scrap some paint off before hanging things using this tape.This is useful and highly adhesive mounting tape that can be used for a number of applications. I found it useful for mounting posters, but it has a number of other applications as well. It offers a good amount for the price.This Scotch mounting tape is sticky enough to hold heavier items, but it also removes easily without taking the finish with it. For heavier items, I put more on the back of the wall hanging, or object, and on lighter items I use less. Also, it really sticks to ceramic, even if it has a glossy glaze! Some mounting tape is not gonna stick to slick surfaces no matter how much you use, but with this product, only one two-inch strip firmly held tiles I mounted above our cooktop. Midstream, I decided I wanted the tiles in a different arrangement, and it was easy to lift them off the wall, without tearing the paint, and move them. (I think when dry, and "set" they might not be so easy to move, because the tape is so sticky, so we'll see.) Excellent, effective, and easy to use product! Recommended.I've purchased a wider version of this tape to re-affix a soap/shampoo dispenser in the shower. It worked well even in that damp environment, loosing only after 2 years.This narrower size is proving very handy around the office. For example, I needed to to attach an incoming mail container on the edge of my bookcase, and this tape worked perfectly.Not much else to say. The tape is handy and easy to cut for custom fits; the protective paper peels off easily!I have used this product in both in the tape and squares form for many years.  I live in California where we get many little earthquakes, and I have grandchildren who occasionally slam doors, so anything hanging on the walls could shift. I can't stand having mirrors, pictures, clocks, etc. hanging crooked.  I hang the object with a picture-hangar which holds the weight, but always put mounting tape at two corners which holds the frame straight on the wall. This mounting tape is permanent - so place it where you want it to stay.  I would never put it on the back of a clock, for instance, if the battery will need changing once a year.  I have found it takes patience to remove it from any surface.  This product is also useful for mounting on surfaces that cannot tolerate a nail or screw hole.  Scotch mounting tape is part of my tool box arsenal.There is not too much to say about mounting tape in general, except when it does not meet expectations. This baby does what's it's supposed to do, easy to open/place/replace, and you are good to go.This tape works great on the signage I have in my office.  The signs are thin sheets of plastic that I have to adhere to wooden doors and cement walls.  So far, I've had no problems using the tape.  Recommended.Use it all the time ...to stick things BETTER than regular tape. It has grip and a good hold ... like a stopwatch I have mounted in my gym ... it is always there for me and has stayed up for years now.We use this tape to mount kids' art work to the refrigerator.  It works well and stays on far better than magnets.This tape is proving to be very useful.  Thus far, it has held securely.  You can even use it to hold up a big table-top flush against the wall.  The only problem that you have to be careful with the paint.  If you decide that you hung up your picture in the wrong place and try to move it, some of the paint may come off.  Although I guess you should expect that.  It is, after all, permanent tape.  All, in all, it delivers on its promise: allowing you to hang things up without bothering with nails.  And the price is right.  I recommend it.If you have something such as a poster, sign, or brochure holder that you'd like to mount on a wall or other solid surface this is a useful product. The tape is a half inch wide and has adhesive on both sides. It works best on a smooth surface and is fairly strong (recommended for holding up to 2 lbs). This could be used for a variety of projects where you wish to mount something permanently on a wall. If you'd rather not nail or screw something into the wall then this is a good alternative - just don't expect for this tape to come off later without leaving a residue that you'll need to clean or scrape off. Also, there's no tape-cutting mechanism on the roll so you'll need a scissors or utility knife to cut the tape.Works great, but DO NOT put it on any surface that you don't want it on forever. I'd suggest not using it on drywall at all...you can pull it off of harder surfaces and then goo-gone the leftovers, but it just destroys drywall when pulled off. So if you want permanent mounting on a hard surface, I'd recommend.So far I've used this double sided foam tape to mount photos and mounted a small clock on glass. It hasgood holding power and rated to hold 2 lbs. It does depend what you mount to, someone stated it wouldn'thold on plaster walls, if the surface you use is weak the tape isn't going to change this fact. I mounted abadge back on a cars painted surface, this tape is strong enough for jobs like this. This is a good generaluse double sided white foam tape, the roll is 1/2" wide X 75" long, other sizes are offered but I found thisis a good general use size.This is one of those products that most households should keep on hand, stuck in that "miscellaneous stuff" drawer along with string, packing tape and whatnot.It's mainly good for the purposes Scotch mentions: sticking things up on walls. The 1/16 inch thickness of foam allows for irregularities between your wall and what you're sticking up; if you try to use regular, non-foamdouble sided tapefor anything more substantial than a sheet of paper, you're inviting anengineering disaster.This mounting tape can be considered reasonably permanent--anything that doesn't fall down in the first few hours will probably never fall down. But at the same time, it's semi-removable; If you ever have to take down whatever you've stuck up with this stuff, you can usually do so with little or no damage to the object or the wall. If the wall is painted removing the tape will most likely take off the paint in that area too. But for surfaces like tile, plastic or enamel (i.e. refrigerators), a layer of the tape will stay behind, and this can be removed with paint thinner or something likeGoo Gone(along with a fair amount of elbow grease).In short, it's good stuff to have around.This tape is definitely useful in a lot of ways.  Picture hanging (if it isn't too heavy or fragile), securing items to shelves so they don't get broken, I also used some to keep a shoe holder on my closet shelf from sliding.  There are so many ways this can be used, the limit is your imagination.  Keep in mind, though, that this isn't like Command strips...you can (and probably will) lose some paint or do damage on finished surfaces when you go to remove it.  As long as you're not worried about it being permanent, I highly recommend it.Scotch 1/2" Mounting Tape comes in very handy for many uses. Last week I installed several new devices in my living room home entertainment cabinet. This mounting tape worked great for cord control, routing and organization. I used it to mount a Roku box on the inside of a cabinet sidewall. it is being held firmly and even the pressure from some of the cables and wires trying to push it away from the wall has not sprung it. I also mounted a small antenna amplifier to the back of a flat screen TV. I'll be curious to see how the heat from the television effects the tape over time. If it's bad news I'll let you know. Good Stuff!Love this stuff b/c the adhesive lasts and you don't need much. Some of my small breakables on shelves are now more earthquake-ready. I also used this to stick onto the back of a notebook, then stuck the notebook on my non-magnetic fridge. Instant shopping list! Many possible uses. Recommended.I create presentation boards for design presentations and I often find myself needing to affix a piece of marble, tile or carpet to the board. Glue doesn't hold and regular tape is a joke. Scotch mounting tape, however, does the job. Normally if I affix a piece of marble it has fallen off of the board by the end of the day - I have marble still sticking to the board weeks later and no signs of letting go. This tape is amazing and, though I can't say for sure, it truly seems to be a permanent tape. Highly recommended.I live in an old, old house, and the horsehair plaster in the walls can crack horribly if you hit it with a nail.  Up until now, my solution has been to keep anything heavier than a poster off my walls, and posters just aren't exactly grown-up decor.Then I got this mounting tape.  It's permanent, so I was very careful about finding a spot for a piece of lightweight art, a small piece of framed needlepoint.  I followed the directions and used plenty of tape, and I wiped down the wall with alcohol before smushing the picture frame onto the wall.  It holds perfectly.I've used a similar Scotch product that was cut into 1" squares, and wouldn't be without it.  It holds my precious items onto my plate rail in the dining room, and keeps the photos on the picture rail. This product is even better - because it comes on a roll, it stays cleaner and dispenses more easily.Yet another Scotch product that's an absolute must in my house.  I'm going to need a drawer dedicated to their products before long! (But I won't tell anyone, because everyone thinks I'm weird already)Need something stuck to something else?  This stuff does the trick.  I had one of those license plate thingys to put on the front of my car and no bolts to do it.  So I whipped out my Scotch Mounting Tape and stuck it on there.  It's been on ever since without even trying to come off.  WOO HOO!  It works well in the house too for those small photo frames on the wall.  GOOD PRODUCT--GET IT!Scotch states this is for permanent mounting, but I'd hold back on that until a year goes by.  I did use it for a wall calendar which is nice, in that I don't have to drive a nail into the wall.  But the biggest use I have for Scotch's (double sided) mounting tape is for flat surfaces.  Where most people have kids knocking things about, I have little earthquakes but most horrendously, cats!  My two Bengal cats will knock anything and everything off the shelves or countertops.  I have some glass vases, vertical standing frames and a glass decanter sitting on shelves.  I used this tape to mount them strongly to the shelf.  I've witnessed these cats walking all around them without being able to knock them off to shatter on the floor.  For that peace of mind alone, this tape is worth it.  Plus the price is right.Putting objects, other than pictures, on the wall can be daunting.  The permanent mounting tape is easy to use and seems to work well so far.  Pealing the tape is easy and mounting it is also simple.  I also have used it for creating art projects where I want certain items to stick on without the use of messy glue.Of course nails and screws work well for hanging things, but I don't always want to put more holes in the walls of my house.  Holes can be hard to fill and hide even when you paint over the surface.  So the tape is simple and can be used on most wall surfaces including tile and wood. It's difficult to put nails into tile, so this product takes care of that.It's also handy since it's a simple roll of tape.  I don't need other equipment and there is no cleaning up. So for that unusual project, I think it's great to have on hand.  The only question is whether it will be easy to remove and clean up if I want to take if off the wall or off the other items.My house was built in the 1950s and the interior walls are covered in plaster not dry wall. This stuff is as hard as rock and even small pictures take substantial nails as the nail has to be strong enough to survive the pounding. Double sided mounting tape seemed like a great idea.The trial was made with a framed picture weighing about eight ounces. Tape was placed across the back of the frame at the top and another strip at the bottom. The picture was pressed into place above a peg board of hooks, which supported the weight of the picture. All the tape had to do was to hold on.The picture stayed in place about 36 hours and then fell down with a clatter. I note two things that partially excuse this: the plaster wall is rough with a gritty texture and the picture's placement was near a heat vent. This mounting tape held on longer than any similar product, but that isn't saying much.I used these to hang up a big board & they worked. they really serve their purpose & holds up greatThis mounting tape has worked out well on many different surfaces. It is pretty strong too. I have actually used it to hang smaller/lighter pictures in frames and none have come falling down..yet. There is a good amount of tape in the roll, so you can get a good number of things hung with it. I also used it to hang one of the full length door mirrors on my daughter's bedroom door. It has held so far so good..and that is even with her slamming the door at times. I am getting pretty brave at using it for larger, heavier items - I just make sure to use a good bit of the tape around all edges, so that it is secure.There are times when flat tape just isn't appropriate. Especially when one (or both) surfaces aren't completely smooth or flat. This is what you need. I have some wiremold that holds electrical wires to a baseboard, and when it came time to attach it, I knew exactly that type of tape I needed. The slight "sponginess" to the material, forgives any imperfections in the items to be adhered. Regular tape just leaves gaps.It IS difficult to remove, though. The thickness of the material will often result in removing only a layer of it, so be careful where you mount with it. On the other hand, when things don't stick with regular tape, THIS is what you need. BTW, for wet applications (and others where I want LESS permanence) I have used theCommand Adhesivemounting strips. They come inwater-resistant, too. They are only tabs...so it takes a few to hang things (while this is a nice long uninterrupted roll where you can choose your own size.)This is just a product that serves its particular purpose perfectly!!I have used this on tile, metal, glass and interior walls and all surfaces are compatible with this mounting tape in my experience.  I did notice that if the surface is ice cold, make sure you warm the area up with a hairdryer if possible for a better stick.  To remove, I slid a razor through the foam core and used Goo Gone to remove the rest of the square, worked great!  I was able to hang a wipe board near my front door than I had been meaning to mount for months, this stuff gets the job done!Used to resecure my pet window seat, still holding up to 14 pound cat, jumping to see the birdies!I am happy camper, and so is my cat!Don't know how good it will withstand 62 pounds of fur yet, but that wouldn't be the tape's fault! :-)Excellent stuff.I received this product through the Vine program.  I had a couple of exit signs to mount (the light weight flat signs, non lighted) and did not want to drill holes in the plaster walls to do it.  I tried this tape and it works great!  I put tape along each of the sides of the signs and then pressed them in place.  Instant mounting and they hold great!I also tried using this tape to mount a couple of plastic in boxes (the angled ones designed for wall mounting) on the side of a file cabinet.  It works great and I did not need to drill the cabinet to mount it with.  I have placed around 40 sheets of paper (letter size) in one of the boxes and filled the other with incoming mail and the tape has held well.  Nothing has separated and the installation looks neat.I have not tried removing anything so I can not attest to the ease or difficulty of removing items mounted with this tape.  I can say though that as long as what you want to mount does not weigh a lot, this tape works well.There's not much to say. This is double-sided mounting tape, and it holds tight. It's easy to apply, and works for most lightweight mounting jobs. It is labeled as "permanent", so I wouldn't recommend using this on anything you want to eventually remove it from. It's not coming off without some effort and residue left behind.My only complaint is that it's a small roll, but that's to be expected.There's really no competition. 3M basically invented this sort of thing.There are many applications for this tape, but our favorite is in kids projects.  The foam layer between the two sides of tape allows you to connect two surfaces that would not lie completely flush against each other (making it impossible to use regular two-sided tape).  The foam also gives a little bit of flexibility and shock resistance; for example, mounting something inside a remote control vehicle.  Also, while this is meant as permanent tape, the foam layer can, in some applications, give you a way to pry off whatever you've taped.  We keep a roll of this on our workshop bench as there is invariably some situation where it is preferable to gluing, nailing, sewing, velcroing, etc.Not too much to say here: works great and sticks solid to most surfaces unless they are oily. I used this mounting tape in my classroom for mounting bulletin boards in the room (as well as to hold in place while silicone glue dried) and had no problems. Highly recommended.Great product we used it mount all our travel photos above are bed. One helpful hint, be sure to allow the paint to cure for a few weeks, so that it doesn't lifts off easily. Also, we found it worked best when you prime the walls before you paint it makes a difference when using mounting tape. The paint and texture don't come off so easily when you take the tape off later--which is great. We change out the photos every few months when we go on another trip. We have some photos that have been up for over a year and there is no lift in the corners like you see with other mounting two side tape.We have been using Scotch brand tape products for decades but not, until now, have we used this product. It is difficult to rate it because of infrequent need but on the one occasion we have used it thus far, it did all that we had hoped it would. If the item remains firmly attached after a month or so, I will add a star to my rating. Meanwhile, perhaps other uses will emerge. Tests and evaluations continue.Meanwhile, again, I say "Thank You" to the Amazonians for the Vine Program.I mean, not like someone doesn't make a dispenser for this stuff. If 3M wanted to, they could probably make anything having to do with adhesion. Probably already have.This double-sided tape is the standard by which others should be judged. Or not, I cannot recall ever seeing a competitor to this product, if I did I would not even bother checking it out. How can you improve perfection? What Scotch 33 is to electrical tape, this mounting tape is to.. everything else. If you have two smooth- or even slightly irregular surfaces needing to be stuck together, here it is. The uses are innumerable. I use it to affix magnets to notepads for refrigerator use. I use it to make model furniture mock-ups while in the design process. I use it to stick co-workers keyboards and mice to their desks when they are away.Awhile back 3M introduced these little gel-like squares that were also double-sided adhesive, and while they would definitely do some things the foam tape would not, they fell far short in sheer versatility.i must admit I prefer the 3/4" or 1" width, but this is the size generally found in most any type of store. No tool box, drawer or glovebox should be without a roll.This product is excellent for mounting items.  It is very sticky and you get a good amount of tape in each package.  The price is right too - overall a great buy.  Highly recommended.This is an excellent double sided mounting tape for small items. However, you have to make sure the surface you attach it to is absolutely clean. If there is oil, dirt, grease, etc, it is not going to stick for very long. And the surface you attach it to has to be dry and stay dry and it has to be strong enough to hold whatever you are mounting. If the surface has been waxed, it may not stick for very long. All you have to do is clean the area where you are going to use it and it will do an excellent job. This is a light to medium strength mounting tape and should not be subject to heat or vibration. If you want to mount something in your car or boat, there are other very high strength mounting tapes. If you want to mount a small picture or similar then use 4 good sized pieces, one in each corner, don't use just one in the middle. This mounting tape would be excellent for mounting poster boards.I originally thought to use this product just for scrapbooking and card making, to add dimension.  For this it's wonderful, and easy to use.  Small pieces are easy to cut, since both sides of the tape is covered with a protective paper that you remove to expose the adhesive.  Remove one side, affix to your "scrap", then remove the remaining paper, and stick everything in place.  Easy,holds permanently, and looks good, providing a nice dimensional look.  I have an idea or two for some great 3D xmas cards next season.But I also found out that this tape works wonderful to stick up things like cork tiles onto the inside of cupboard doors..  I orginally used UGO squares, which does have the advantage of being removable, but it did NOT stay stuck.  After a week or so, the cork tile fell down.  I had replaced it with more of the same, and had another failure.  So I replaced it with pieces of the Scotch Mounting tape, and it's still attached.  It's my new go-to craft sticky.  :-)So far, I have hung a few things (nothing too heavy) and this product works well. It is easy enough to cut and dispense as I need, holds steady and firm, and did not tear the paper I had it affixed to when I went to move it. It moved cleanly and left no marks. Instead of using tacks that leave marks, use this product to stick items to surfaces without destroying the surface or the product you are displaying.Let me just say that 3M is an awesome company! I have yet to come across any of their products that do not perform as advertised. I recently purchased their Headlight Restoration Kit3M 39008 Headlight Lens Restoration Systemthat is just plain awesome. It worked so well that I find myself looking - proudly, I might add! - at my headlights on a daily basis. Check out that review in a few days.The Scotch mounting tape is an easy to use double-sided heavy duty foam tape. I have used it successfully for numerous things around the house and garage...here are a few examples:* School projects where heavier objects were required to be attached to project boards.* Mounting 4x4 ceramic tiles, that our pre-K kids created for father's day, temporarily to sheet rock - It could have handled the ceramic tiles permanently.* Securing a GPS mount on an automotive dash - I installed away from direct sunlight coz' nothing holds in sunlight!* Mounting steel spice boxes on to ceramic tile* Hand towel hooks in the garage and laundryThe only drawback is lack of a dispenser or storage case. The outer wrap does come a little loose and any part of the tape that picks up dust, lint, etc. is unusable.Some reviews of Scotch 1/2" Permanent Mounting Tape say that it's good for photo albums. Maybe, but I don't think I'd use it for that, because it's rather thick: 0.065". Its thickness isn't an issue for other applications, though, such as mounting posters or whatever to a wall.Other reviews say this tape will stick to anything, but really it is designed for smooth surfaces. If you used a lot, maybe you could use it on a cinder block, but it would be better to buy tape designed for that.I was concerned about the "Permanent" description. The last thing I wanted was to have to chip old tape off my wall. I did some tests and was happy to discover that permanent here means that it is made to be used once only and that it will last a long time. Removing tape that I'd stuck to my wall was very easy and caused no damage at all.This is very good tape for affixing items to a wall or other smooth surface.I used this to mount a couple rear view mirrors to my computer monitors at work (so that people don't sneak up on me since my back is to the aisle) and FINALLY I found a product that keeps them attached. I've tried several different products that don't seem to last long, but this one appears that it is tough enough to last.Scotch 1/2 inch Mounting Tape is a padded, double sided tape on a 75 inch roll. One side gets applied to an object, and the other side gets pressed against a surface on which you wish to mount your object. The cushion between the adhesive layers gives you flexibility when it comes to mounting objects that do not lie flat against one another.This mounting tape is designed to be permanent and is not repositionable. The user must take care to line up objects carefully when mounting them, and there is no guarantee that the surface of your walls will be completely immune to damage when this is removed. For some items, it might be helpful to mark its desired position before mounting, or use a small level.For some items, mounting tape is an ideal solution. For example, one of my children made an art project on a 36 square inch ceramic tile. There was no way to nail it to a wall, and adhesive hangers with flaps for mounting on picture hooks don't always hold up to the task. Due to the irregular surface on the back of ceramic tiles, the foam padding is needed to provide the thickness and to allow for irregularities in the surface.As a rule, you should use about a half inch of this tape per ounce of weight. I used 5.5 inches for the ceramic tile, and the bond is as strong as would ever be needed. The package says that it holds up to 2 lbs, which presumably refers to the maximum weight of each object to be mounted. The roll is long enough to support a total of over nine pounds worth of items. Sixty 4 by 6 photographs weigh about nine ounces, so this roll can go a long way.The tape itself comes in a roll with no dispenser and with a single backing strip between layers. Therefore, you can't pre-cut a section and hold onto it for later. But you can cut off the amount you need, apply it to an object, and leave the backing layer in place until you are ready to mount your object.There's nothing new or innovative about this product, but this product is very well suited to its task. It can also be used for a wider variety of tasks, but it might be best to save it for those special tasks for which it outshines other solutions. Although it can replace anything from thumbtacks to picture hooks, thumbtacks are cheaper and this product might be overkill. As double sided padded adhesive tapes go, this one does the job as well as can be expected.If you have items that you want to mount on the wall, but don't want to drive nails, this is the tape for you.  I have used this to put up small pictures in my daughters' rooms, and it works great.  I wouldn't trust any kind of tape for large pictures, but that is not why you would buy this.One thing to be aware of....it's biggest strength is also somewhat of a weakness.  Once you put something on the wall with this tape, it is staying on the wall.  It does not remove easily, and thus is not suitable for mounting things you may want to move from time to time (i.e. posters in a child's room, wall calendars, etc.). They make other kind of lightweight, low adhesion tapes, that might be more suitable for that.Overall....great at what it does and recommended.My sunhat was too big, so I got the idea of lining the inside with the mounting tape.  It did the trick.  Hat no longer falls over my ears.  Good for all the other usual uses as well.  Handy to have around.We use this around the office. It holds pretty well. It holds a phone headset against the wall.  The longer the strip you use the better the strength is.  It leaves a slight sticky residue once its removed, but you can get rid of it with some soap and water.This is heavy duty. I use it for everything. I even put up canvas Frames with it. Very easy to use and not to hard to remove.Got this for putting on a plastic cable cord cover to hold in place on the carpet after I had to move it and the original double sided tape came off and wouldn't stick any longer.  This stuff is strong and works well even though it is more meant for smooth surfaces than for what I used it for.Do I need to say more. Scotch is trusted because they make the best adhessive products on the market. Works for meThis tape is the answer for many, many needs. It can be used to hold a speaker in place rather than watch it role off a shelf or bureau. It hold computer accessories to the desk. It can be removed without much effort. Need a little goop cleaner. It's the million use tape that leaves Duct Tape in the DUST!I have used this product for at least ten years. It has never failed me. The sticky sides last and last and last. I use it for a multitude of things. My old 1/2" roll was marked by me in 2003 and is still going strong. Great product. I definitley do recommend.This is a strong tape and there is a lot of it for the price. It is a very useful tape to have in your toolbox.I put up a solar light on my brick fence wall in the back yard using this tape.  It really holds well and the light as not budged.  Saved me from having to drill holes in the wall. Highly recommend.I have these same 3M mounting tapes each with different mounting weight. Used them for many reasons for many years and have not failed me.I bought this thinking it was like the 3M stuff I bought in the past; clear and very sticky. This tape is a gray color and is not as sticky. I'm not sure what model tape the clear stuff was but it was great. This tape is still good but not quite as strong as I would like. I bought several rolls to hang some reflective barrier on my garage door. So far it is holding up well with the heat.It's double sided tape and it does what double sided tape... with one exception. It is stupid strong (not sure what stupid strong is, but it sounds good) and it's not coming off once you put it on.Good Tape for using outside. I bought it to secure my wireless bell button on the outside of the house.Holds things very well just as you would expect from 3M. I used indoor so can not say much about it working outside.I mounted a clock to my  motorcycle with this and it has been on for a few hundred miles. That's all I need it to do and it was a success.This tape is great for hardware projects requiring a high strength but potentially temporary bond. I have often used it for building mechanical and electrical gadgets as well as for repairs on household items. It has worked well on both flat and irregular surfaces.  I would highly recommend the Scotch exterior mounting tape over the foam-based tapes for any project -- indoor or outside as it holds up better under repeated mechanical stress.In one example, I used this tape to affix several one pound lead weights to flight simulator rudder pedals that were ultimately removed. The removal was an arduous process. I found that using a Weller heat gun and hand scraper was the best method. If you are using this mounting tape in situation where it may need to be removed, you might was to check the durability of the surface first as any paint/finish could be damaged.This is the best mounting tape I have ever used and I swear by it! If I want something to stick on then I will use this tape. This is the gorilla tape of double sided tapes. Perfect, and will adhere to almost any surface you can find, and rather permanently if it is smooth.It sticks, it works as described and seems to last.  $5 for 60 inches is too expensive but that is a competitive price for this junk.Here is a re-post of my review for the same product but for 450" roll instead of this 60" roll.  I recommend the 450" roll because at the current price, the 450" roll is 3 times the price of this 60" roll and you get 7.5 times the length of material.  A much better value, and if you like it as much as I do... YOU WILL WANT IT.Scotch Permanent Outdoor Mounting Tape, 1 Inch x 450 Inches (4011-LONG)I call this sticky tape stuff because when I started using it, I found it to be less a double-sided mounting tape and more like a thin sheet of sticky gum. This stuff stretches out to much longer and narrower or can be folded upon itself to be thicker. Sticky stuff.Value:This 450 inch roll is the much better value than the 60 inch roll on the site (4 cents per inch versus 10 cents per inch).Does it work:I haven't found any type of mounting or double sided tape that comes anywhere near this in sticking ability. I use this in my garage to mount some padded rubber surfaces (very light) to a cinder block wall to protect my car doors, through extreme heat and cold, the surface has stuck. I use this to mount a plastic device that attaches hoses to a window (for an in-room AC unit) which gets a significant amount of torque from the heavy hoses, absolutely no issue. So, yes, it works.That's it... if you are a do-it-yourself'er, this is a must have for your tool kit.These are faily strong outdoor tape. I bought this to hang a sign outside my door and after over a year the sign is still there hanging on to concrete. Good price too.This Belkin Standard Mouse Pad is useful for my spare computer.  However, I find that I prefer a smooth surface to a cloth-type surface.It's a basic, no-frills mouse pad. I.e., it works. I love it when a product doesn't do too much, and mouse pads are notorious for trying to do too much. So thank you, Belkin.It is a cheap simple mouse pad for your mouse. If that is what you are looking for then this is your mouse mat!This is an inexpensive Mouse Pad, but it does it's job and holds up well for the price. If you are looking for a mouse pad, don't bother buying the more expensive ones, this one does just fine.Although it is plain, it seems to last forever.  And the price is unbelievable!!!  I used my first one on my make-up table to &#34;catch&#34; any spills or mascara smudges.  The other I will use to replace my current mousepad.  I will continue to buy these as I think of other uses for them!!For a small price this is a basic mouse pad. It doesn't smell like roses and it doesn't greet you by name when you sit down. It just acts like a mouse pad, presuming that this is just what you want.This Belkin Standard Mouse Pad measures 7-7/8 x 9-7/8 x 3/16 inch thick.  It has a fine-textured fabric top and a foam rubber back.  It is plain vanilla - there is no picture of cute kittens or puppies but it does the job at a very reasonable price.  I recommend it to budget-minded Amazon shoppers.I've used many different typs of mouse pads with many different kinds on surfaces and I've always liked the one color darker type cloth pads. The pads with patterns and things printed on them can cause a problem with some laser mice and I've run into that many times. The back surface is great and the thing I liked best was it wasn't to thick. Some pads have a really thick rubber base and that tends to raise the pad a bit to high for me. I have my mouse pad holder mounted to the left side of my KB on a center desk drawer and this pad nicely covers the whole surface and isn't to thick as my old one was. The darker color seems to have helped my tracking too. I've ordered two more of these, one for another computer's mouse and a spare. Really like this pad!For me, I tried this very nice quality Blue Belkin Standard Mouse Pad and was happily surprised. This mouse pad works well with any type of mouse I tried and any brand of mouse I tried! First, I tried the MS Wireless Mouse and the mouse moved so well over this pad. Then I tried out my new Verbatim Mini Mouse (the retractable type). The Verbatim mouse moved very well over this pad. In addition, the back of this mouse pad is coated and stays in place (no slipping on my desk--it stays nicely in place).Looking for a very good quality and basic mouse pad that works without paying a high cost? Look no further, this is the mouse pad I suggest to you. And I believe that you will be very happy with it.Highly recommend this Belkin Mouse Pad!What's not to like about a mouse pad that does its job without eating the mouse? If you need a pad, try this one.Look, it is a mouse pad.  It really doesn't even &#34;work&#34; - it just is, except when it comes apart.  Two days, that's all I got. Bad Dog.I was so skeptical because of the low price however I decided to go for it. I ordered 5 because I can never find a mouse pad when I need one. Plus stores are way to expensive. These work perfect. They are standard size, very light weight and they stay in place!I needed a few cheap mouse pads and these are great.  94 cents and problems solved.  I wish all problems could be solved this easily.NICE FOR THE PRICE. I HAD EARLIER ORDERED A MOUSE PAD FROM AMAZON WHICH STATED IT HAD A CALENDAR ON IT. i THOUGHT IT WAS EMBEDDED IN THE PAD. FOOL THAT I MAY BE. IT WAS NOT. IT WAS PAPERS ALL IN A CALENDAR AND STUCK TO A PIECE OF CARDBOARD. I EVEN PAID SHIPPING. IT SELF DESTROYED AND I COULD NOT RETURN IT. BUT WRITE IT UP I WILL.THIS IS THE REPLACEMNT.UNTIL I FIND ONE I CAN SEE AND FEEL IN A STORE SOMEWHERE THAT HAS A NICE PHOTO ON IT, THIS WILL BE FINE. JUST FINE. I AM HAPPY TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT ADHERES TO THE DESK AND LETS MY MOUSE ROLL FOR A COUPLE OF DOLLARS. IT IS JUST FINE.I spend a lot of time in a chair (handicapped), and my mouse didn't work very well on the fabric.  Bought this little guy, and the mouse works perfectly now.The color was coming off within a few weeks.  Within a month, all the edges are peeling.  This has got to be one of the worst mousepads ever made.I got this for very cheap and well worth it as an add-on item, a few days later the price doubled as most things on Amazon do. Just keep watching the item you might score.Does as I expected for a mouse pad.  Is thin, as most mouse pads I see in the stores, but costs a fraction of the cost in the store.  Love it.This is a very ordinary mousepad, though the Belkin name at least assures you of decent quality for a mundane yet necessary item.  It replaces a dirty, ink-stained, slightly smaller red mouse pad.  My 5-star rating includes considerations of pricing and packaging along with Belkin quality.  I've received similar pads that were all rolled up and misshapen so that they would fit into cheap packaging and require less postage.  But as a Prime product, this two dollar mouse pad, rest assured, will arrive in a full and firm cardboard box.  No unfolding, pressing, or ironing required before you're able to use it without agitation.  The pad, moreover, is sealed in a Belkin cellophane wrap, making it a nice, inexpensive gift for a friend or associate on an otherwise overcast day.We needed several mouse pads for public areas and shared work spaces. These have a way of disappearing so we did not want to spend a lot. These serve the exact purpose.Not great, but just fine.  It was a great price, so it serves the purpose.  I used it in a classroom I teach in that didn't have one.  Glad I didn't have to pay too much for it...no one reimburses us for things like this.I have one in red also, I bought both at the same time.After just a few days of use, the top (colored) layer is separating from the bottom (base) layer.Belkin usually makes high quality products.I'm very disappointed in these mouse pads.I would not recommend them.I find it completely unnecessary.  I can use my mouse by simply moving it around the top of my desk as I desire and I works perfectly well.  so, with the new designs I see no need whatsoever for these pads.  Other than that, if you like them, this is a nice and inexpensive one.Good mouse pad. Mouse glides easily. Was bent when it arrived but has finally straightened out. I don't really like the thin plastic top but it works fine.This mousepad has a plasticky surface and the mouse glides smoothly and accurately. Definitely recommend. For the price, this one can't be beat. I also tried the 3m mousepad which costs more but performs the same as this one.You would think that if you have saw one basic mouse pad you have saw them all.  However I think this product could be better.  After comparing to another mouse pad that is of slightly higher quality and price I find I will more than likely opt for the other unit in the future.It is indeed blue, flat and provides a stable horizontal surface for a mouse. All for less than $2 and without having to suffer the indignity of going inside an Office Depot or Staples. For that reason alone, it would be a bargain at twice the price.Great pad for putting under washer feet to keep washer from vibrating around great price would highly recommend but no for a mouse pad!This is a basic mouse pad. It has no bells and whistles. It functions perfectly and I would buy it again.I ordered 2 premium mousepads.  Amazon sent 1 premium and one 65 cent standard blue.The premium one makes my new-ish Logitech optical mouse skip, hang, lag.  It does work on my 15 year old Microsoft Explorer optical mouse.Also, the edges are so sharp I feel like I'm going to slit my wrist on it.Would not recommend.It's light, cheap and it gets the job done. I use it with my Logitech M510 mouse and it works great. So much that I've ordered two--one for the home, one for the office and my girlfriend got one as well.I couldn't decide which mouse pad to buy and this one was so cheap, I bought this Belkin one along with this one: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017D5Z40After testing them both, Belkin might be cheaper but its thick and doesn't track as well for laser/optical.Go Belkin if you still use a trackball.  Otherwise spend a few more dollars for the thinner better mouse pad.How bad can a mouse pad be?  That's what I thought....First, be aware this is a HARD top mouse pad.  Basically, it is a hard sheet of blue plastic glued onto a 3/32" foam pad.  Not a rubber pad like other mouse pads, but a foamy pad.The plastic top is bigger than the foam pad on all sides, and cuts into my hand which rests on the edge of the pad.The mouse pad isn't quite flat on the table - the plastic top is slightly curled and one edge of the mouse pad sticks up slightly until I push the mouse over it.  It is very distracting.Finally, the surface is just rough enough to make a loud scratchy nose as my optical mouse moves over it.  VERY annoying.This is the WORST mouse pad I've ever used.The only pro is it has a weird new plastic smell that reminds me of grape popsicles, so 2 stars.11-ish bucks. The construction probably wouldn't hold from textbooks but for eReaders, paper, and smaller books it'll do the job. I wish I had this throughout HS. Would have made copying things easier.This stand may be good for pamphlets, ring-bound manuals, magazines and typing sheets but definitely not for text books. It is unstable and the page holders can't hold any page open for even a nano second. Try the The Easi-Reader Bookstand or Mighty Bright Folding/Adjustable Book Holder instead.I don't understand the number of negative reviews... this product works great.  Some reviewers said it's plastic and breaks easily.  Yes, it's plastic and I suppose you could break it without too much difficulty but it doesn't break under normal use.  I use mine to hold open textbooks that measure 10"x16" (when open) and are over 500 pages.  The book holder works fine in all respects.  Specifically, it supports the book without tipping or wobbling as I turn the pages, the pages are prevented from turning by themselves even with a fan blowing on it, I can slide it across my desk without it collapsing and when I'm done it folds flat for easy storage.  One feature I really like is the fact that the tabs that normally hold the pages in place can be folded flat to accommodate very large books (700+ pages).  I don't know what else I could ask from a product such as this!  I can recommend this product without reservation.Simple product. Does exactly what I need it to. Cant say anything bad about it. Very happy with the purchase.Its a book holder plain and simple. For the price, the product itself is very useful and functional. There are better bookstands out there, but youll have to pay for itThis book holder is made of plastic and seems a little flimsy, but so far it's holding up decently. The back stand uses two pieces, and is adjustable. There are two tabs in the front which you can move forward and backward so that you can turn pages more easily or insert new books without fear of ruining a page. They are also a problem. I have found that they can pop out from use as they only have a fitted notch keeping them in place at the bottom of the unit.I can also see how a book larger than 2 inches in thickness can be an issue, as the depth of the base is roughly an inch deep. I've not yet had to work with this (I use it for typing up class notes from notebooks at this time) with a book of that size, but i can picture my coffee cup coming into play if I ever use it with a book of that size.I'm really enjoy this book holder. It holds large and small books at various weights. At first I didn't think it would because it's made out of plastic, but it's pretty sturdy. Also love the fact that it folds up and can be inserted in a binder for easy transportation.This is a friendly book holder. I use this everyday in my studio. It holds the pages of my books open and can be adjusted to any angle I choose. I'm thinking about buying another for my cook books in the house. I have to lift the book out of the one in the house to turn the page.This book holder works well even with large books. It can be folded flat for easy storage in a briefcase. It's an expensive. I would not hesitate to buy another one if I needed it.I've been using their labels for more than 20 years -- they are SO easy to use on the computer, and these 08167 labels print equally well on my Ink Jet AND laser printer.Feeding them through a copier is a cinch too.These 08167 labels peel easily, the ink impressions are sharp and crisp, in color OR black and white.I have had no problem with the Avery labels' adhesive longevity in the past -- let's see how well these 08167's do -- I would think that they will be just as good as their predecessors.It's hard to review this type of product. They work, they did not smudge, and they are compatible with word. We also used some to cover up old file labels. They shipped and arrived quickly.Great labels. In the past I have bought other brands and the labels stick to the printer, get jammed up. No smudging, line up nicely and don't get caught up in my printer - definately a plus! Avery products are superior in my opinion. A definate buy.On first glance these labels look very small, and they are small, but they are "Return Address" labels.  While they could be a little bigger, I was able to fit my address on them with a small picture in front of it (street and apartment number on same line).  You are realistically only going to be able to fit 3 lines on a label (at about 8pt font), so don't expect more than that.  The labels I printed on my inkjet printer were very clear and the colors looked great.  The template allows you to print several styles on a single sheet, which I had printed a few different ones including a small picture to the left of my address and ones with a faded picture in the background.  I am using these as both customized return address labels and address correction stickers on my checks (they are the PERFECT size for that).  I have only used them on regular envelopes and checks to which they applied easily and did not peel at the edges.The "Pop-Up Edge" is a very interesting idea, and is a time-saving way to peel the labels from the sheet.  You simply fold the sheet a little along the perforation and the edge of the labels stick out for you to grab.Word of caution:  Depending on your printer, the printing may be off center or higher on the label than expected.  I'm almost positive this is my printer because I have had this issue with mailing seals as well, but just wanted to advise others to check this before printing many labels.Love these labels; even though I confess I did use a Laser printer (these are made for Ink Jets), printing was a SNAP!I visited the Avery site, downloaded the Microsoft Word version of Template #5167 and had my business return labels printed within 10 minutes (will be a LOT quicker in the future, now that I've got the template saved to my hard drive).  Final alignment was perfectly centered on each individual label; no fuss.These are REALLY easy to print and use; the pop-up easy peel feature is great, too:  no more struggling to peel printed labels off the sheet.  These peel quickly from the sheet, simply by gently folding the backing slightly.  Great solution for quickly printing 80 return labels per sheet; highly recommended for EASE OF USE.Works well and does not jam up the printer like other brands can.  You can get free templates from the Avery website as well which is a bonus!  I recommend this product!I absolutely love these mailing labels!  They are convenient, and make life so much easier!  These mailing labels are smaller than certain other types of labels; therefore, more labels will fit on each sheet.  And if you use a lot of mailing labels, then that does you a lot of good.They print so quickly and easily.  Whenever you need a label, just peel it off.  These label sheets save a lot of time and energy, and are so neat.Highly recommended if you use mailing labels.And these are for ink jet printers, which is the type of printer I have at home.I love the easy-peel feature on these labels!  I hate when manicures get ruined on the edges due to trying to peel labels!  I experienced some very minor smudging.  The labels adhere well.  I definitely recommend this product.I make greeting cards and wanted something smaller than an address label to put on the back of my cards - just my name and web address. These are great for that. Also with some of the humid weather we have been having my older Avery labels would smear if I put them on the cards right away. I haven't had that issue with these yet.We used these to create return addresses on envelopes we sent out to clients.  It was much easier and faster than hand writing or printing directly to so many envelopes.  Also we were using CD mailers so the printer couldn't print onto that anyway.  These didn't give us any issues and stuck to the envelopes very well.The sell feature on these labels is that they are easy to peel, but they could be much more versatile were they larger and allowed for design.  The template is most basic, and while the small size gives you 2,000 labels per package, I'd rather have 1,000 larger, designable labels.  As they are, I can only fit three lines of text if I use size 8 font!  Improvements can allow for a template that accepts icons/avatars so that one could design according to company logo, season (falling leaves, snowflakes), event (birthday balloons) or holiday (jack o lanterns, bunnies, cornucopia). I'd rather use the pre-printed friendly, cheerful, colorful labels that I receive from charitable orgs.Just hard to beat the AVERY line of labels. These work great in my two printers and they look great after printing. The glue on the back is first class and they are easy to remove from the  sheet.This little labels are really nice. At first, I wondered if I would want to use a label this small and then when I printed a sheet, I realized that these are perfect for use on envelopes, notes, and anything you want to identify. Easy Peel is a great plus here. Avery labels are simply the best and the downloadable templates help those who don't have one in their word processing application.These Labels are smaller then your Average return address label so you might not get the art on it you might have wanted to use. But they are easy to peel and stick and have found TONS of uses for them since they are small I used them to label DvDs and to organzie my food on the shelf so I will know what is missing.I love Avery labels!  Their free templates are easy to find and download.  The labels print flawlessly every time.  And they are durable.  I really can't say enough about these terrific time savers.  I design my own return address labels with a family portrait on them, I print out address labels for my holiday cards, and I print larger labels for packages, all with ease!  If you are looking for high quality labels that won't let you down, Avery is the way to go...These are good, but so are other brands, for example 3M.  Comparing the two, the Avery look thicker/brighter, but when held up to a light, they look about the same.The adhesive on these and the 3M are about the same, which is to say not very strong, but adequate for a small return address label.The Easy Peel feature makes it convenient to remove from the sheet.  But 3M also has this feature.The labels dry quickly and do not smudge.While I cannot find anything significantly wrong with these, I also find nothing really outstanding that is not available from other brands.In the end, I would probably go with whichever is cheaper and/or you can get with free shipping.These work fine. Like every label sheet I find it takes a little working out a template depending on what program you're starting with. My only wish is that these were a little larger so that the type could be bigger. Closer in size to some of the labels often sent out in the mail by organizations as fund raisers. But overall these work well.You'd think address labels would be a standard product by now, but Avery has added several new features that make this product an excellent purchase, especially if you have a color inkjet printer:1) Smudge Free2) Jam Free3) Pop-up Edge for easy peeling4) Squeezes 80 labels x 25 sheets in one package = 2000 address labels!But here is the best feature of all: by going to [...] and selecting templates for product number 8167, you get many designs in Word, all ready to go. You can customize the provided logos and/or fonts of course. This saves a lot of time setting your mailing project up!I ordered these to use as return address labels until my printed ones arrive, but I'm half tempted to not order any more preprinted ones after using these labels!  They're so easy to use, just follow the guidelines provided by Avery and voila, you'll have instant return address labels!  I didn't have any trouble fitting the entire 3-line address onto this label as some others have mentioned, and my favorite part was the fact that they don't smear!  They're easy to peel off and adhere quite well to the envelope, box, etc.  With all the ebay shipping I do, these have come quite in handy.Great product, highly recommend!I was worried that these labels might peel off in my printer and jam it up.  They stayed affixed firmly to the backing sheet and yet were not hard to peel off for use.  Note these are RETURN address labels, so they are quite small.  If you have more than a 3 line address, the printing can get very tiny.  At least you get a lot per page and per package.Avery always has templates for all their labels and they are easy to get to, but they always seem to want your name and e-mail address before they will let you get to the template.  I would imagine they want to send you advertising.Avery is the best quality and I would encourage you to always buy them, even if they are slightly more expensive.  The bargain brands just don't always work as well.  I have had Avery labels on the shelf for years that still work well.  Some of the bargain brands can dry up and come loose sooner.  Avery apparently knows labels very well and the label business.I really liked the "Pop-up Edge for fast peeling. The labels are smaller than I am used to using, however our address printed clearly and completely with no problems.  I found the labels also nice to stick inside books I loan out, recipe cards and I carry a few in my purse.These 1/2" x 1 3/4 inch labels are good for return address labels, but can be useful in so many other places as well. Perfect for labeling a folder that contains multiple topics (like listing surnames in genealogy research) or in drawing attention to a particular fact on a picture postcard for marketing purposes. I like the 1/2" height....up to now I had to settle for 2/3" in the width I needed and that didn't fit just right. These are perfect. The "easy peel"  factor makes it easy to peel the label off the page by simply bending the label edge and it pops right up. Best of all the template for this label page is clearly defined and actually in my offerings choices for my HP four-in-one printer ( I find more and more often that the newer sized labels aren't in my selections and I have to download the template before printing.) These are easy to print and so far haven't smudged or jammed.Avery Easy Peel Return Address Labels for Inkjet Printers, 0.5 x 1.75 Inches, White, Pack of 2000 (08167)Part of my business is printing lots and lots of address labels; for myself as well as for customers. Avery has never let me down. This product, the Easy peel, is superior to every other type I have tried. Not only are they easy to remove, but they stick to the envelop or package better than the cheaper brands. You might think saving a dollar and buying the office brand is a good idea, but those things come off in the mail. My Avery labels ride all the way to their destination. They also hold ink well (I put artwork on them as part of my business).Recommended for commercial and residential use.Ellen C MazeNo other way to get so many return labels for such a low price.  Can print using your choice of fonts and colors.  They are small, so perfect for any size envelope.  They are also good to use when filling out raffle tickets.  Just print up a sheet with name and phone number.  Highly recommend for cost and easy of use.  Not much else to say about a return label.  Good buy.They work as advertised.  Great quality and easy to use.  I can find no fault with them at all.  Make sure this is the size label you want before purchasing and I think you'll be very satisfied.These labels are designed for inkjet printers often found on desktops.  The inkjet priter compatibility is just a coating on the paper that ensures the ink does not wick out and become unreadable in fine fonts.Return address labels have many convenient uses besides their obvious use.  With one line of print down the center, they can be used on CD jewell cases down the spine to form a library system with title and index number for CD changers or ipod lists to data backups and storage libraries.In product design and prototyping we often use this smaller label to print at the far end with the print running vertically with 1 or 2 tiny lines of type, then roll them around wires with only that last part showing.  As designs shrink the smaller labels are very helpful.Avery provides full product support with templates in ms-word format that make printing on a particular label exceptionally easy if your equipment is calibrated with the right drivers.This is a set of return address labels designed for inkjet printer use (no guarantee that it will come out as intended with a laser printer, but it can likely be used in a laser printer if needed).  Avery labels are reliable and all you need to do is follow instructions, using the template for these sheets with your office/wordprocessing software.  Just print and peel and stick the label on your envelope.  This way you can design your own personalized return address labels.  My only suggestion for improving Avery's labels would be to reduce retail prices on them so more people would think of making their own labels.Avery has always provided me with good products and this time is no different.  I think that is the strongest feature - consistency.I like the pop-up edge which aide in removing the labels from the sheet stock.  These feed fine into my Canon printer and are easy to set up with standard software templates.  No issues here; good stuff.These address labels are easy to use, but they are very small.  Had to use 9 pt font to fit the address in the label.  Definitely could not add a picture or graphic to the label because there isn't room.  Easy to peel and economical because so many fit on a page.I can't imagine every buying a printable label that WASN'T made by Avery.  They are like the mafia of paper products.  I have been using all of their printable labels for years and years now.  Their online support for templates and ideas are just the best.-This is their latest creation: The bendable address label thing.  I don't get it - I mean I see what they're trying to do but I think it's kinda lame.  They work fine - I found the template online and printed up a bunch of address labels using my laserjet printer.  No jamming or anything - prints fine.  With this "new" design, there's a crease or cut in the backing behind the labels along one edge of them which allows you to bend the paper to allow for easy peeling.  But to me - it's no different than peeling it normally.  It says you can "bend it back to flat" after you take a label - but so what - you could do that before anyhow.  Plus, with this new design, trying to take ONE label off causes 2 others to peel off a little - and when you lie it flat, they still stick up a little.  I hate that.  I hate taking a label off even a little bit because then it will lose it's sticky-ness sitting there in a drawer until I use it next.-If you REALLY have trouble peeling off labels, then get this.  Otherwise, don't bother.These return address labels are great and really helped me out this Christmas when I had to send out all my Christmas cards.  I can customize them on what season and holiday it is, or just change it up when I want something a little different for my outgoing mail.  Will get these again!I'm a big fan of printing my own return address labels and these are the best ones so far.I went to the Avery website for the free templates and using Microsoft Word,I printed the best labels I've ever printed & it was faster and more accurate than it's ever been.The labels themselves are are the best I've seen so far,you just bend the sheet at the column and the edge of the label pops up so you can peel it off,so much easier than in the past.The reason these are my favorite labels is because they are 1/2 an inch tall and 1 3/4 inch long and are perfect for putting on printed return forms instead of trying to fit my clumsy handwriting in the tiny writing space.I really like these...They're Great!I always like to use the Avery brand for my office supplies and these easy peel return address labels are exactly that. They are easy to peel off and you get a perfect label every time that actually sticks to the envelope and becomes part of the envelope as well. Reccommend highly.I've been using Avery address labels for more than 10 years now.  This newer easy peel is great.  Very happy with the ease of use and quality!I usually love all Avery products and I must say that I'm adding this product to my favorites as well.  These labels printed out well and I had no smearing when I applied them to my mailing envelopes.  Also, what I loved about them that it wasn't hard to peel and reposition them on the envelope once it caught.  The color blended nicely with my white evenlopes so well, that it appeared as if I printed the address on the envelope itself. I love these labels! From now on, I'll be buying these instead of the store brand I always buy.FIrst, before you order these, pay attention to the dimensions listed in the description.  These are RETURN address labels -- the small ones you stick in the corner of the envelope -- NOT the usually-larger address labels that contain the address where you want your letter to go.  They are, therefore, SMALLER than address labels.  Don't order these expecting to get larger labels.  :-)That said, these are excellent quality, print easily in my inkjet printer, and, as the package says, are easy to peel off the backing sheet.  I used one of the templates I got from the Avery website (I'm on a Mac, using Microsoft Word for the Mac), and designed some nice-looking labels.  Don't expect to fit more than 3 lines of small print on each label.  Like I said, these are small.These Avery Easy Peel Return Address labels worked perfectly for me.  The software that you can download from Avery's website installed easily into my mid level Windows 7 machine and was self explanatory to use.  Within a few short minutes I was cranking out my own custom labels with no problems at all.Believe it or not these are the first labels I have ever made myself.  I use a middle of the road HP 4680 printer and they fed into the machine perfectly, never jamming and printed exactly right.  The labels peel off very easily and as advertised they do NOT smear which was something I had wondered about.I honestly can't see why I would need anything else.  They ARE a bit small but these are sold as RETURN address labels and are appropriately sized so bear that in mind.  Reasonably priced as well.The high quality of Avery products is once again found in these Easy Peel Return Address Labels for use with ink jet printers.The labels peel off easily and quickly with only a slight flexion of the carrier sheet material.  In fact, due to the design, flexion of the carrier sheet is really no longer necessary.The fast, easy peel feature is achieved by stripping off the extra surrounding waste label paper that is between the labels.  This leaves the labels as free-standing units on the carrier sheet.For anyone who has ever had to put labels on a number of letters, this saves substantial time and mess.  Other brands really have some catching up to do!I get a little nervous, whenever I try to use a "print it yourself" anything because the templates that they offer often seem to produce slightly off-kilter results.  That's made worse whenever the output in question is small like a return address label.  You know what I'm talking about, the first 8 or so rows print fine and then the text starts to creep off of one label onto the next.  You end up with half a page of usable labels and half a a page destined for the recycle bin.Printing the Avery Easy Peel Return Address Labels was a SUCCESS!I wasn't surprised by the ease of peeling them off the backing, nor was I surprised by the fact that the inkjet-friendly paper was virtually smudge-proof fresh out of the printer.  That's Avery and they do that very well.The pleasant surprise was that I didn't need to create my own template to print the labels.  Now I don't have to use the multitude of free charity labels that routinely mispell my name and such.I use the website to create my labels, works great.  When using the website they always print correctly on the labels and I can add designs for different occasions.I design labels for my classroom library books and don't want to worry that the labels will smudge or begin to peel off after a while.  No worries.  These don't.  Also, they don't jam in my printer or print out of alignment - yay!  I hate wasting color ink on misaligned labels.  I also like how they make application easier due to the pop up feature.I really like the size of these. I hate wasting a bigger label (like an Avery 5160) for return addresses and have even cut them in half sometimes. These are nice because they are smaller. I would have liked them slightly shorter but a touch wider. Mostly because I usually have 3 lines, and it -just- fits. I don't want to use 7pt fonts, either. My text also bled off the top edge on the bottom 5 rows of the sheet a few times. I know my printer isn't perfect everytime it draws a page through, so I realize it isn't completely the product's fault. I use a laser printer, I don't think it matters much that they say "inkjet"...maybe using a laser product in an inkjet might smear, but I never had a problem the other way around. I suppose I can fool around with the margining setup for the label template to alleviate the text "drift."I do like the easy peel and not having to pick at the corners of labels to get them off. I have always liked the quality of Avery labels, and these did not disappoint me. I would get these again.One may think that these labels are not needed, that you can just jot down your return address when mailing items.  This is true, but if you mail items a lot, these are great to increase your speed in getting things in the mailbox before the mailman picks up.  Also, they come in handy for many non-mail related reasons.EASE OF USE: I made labels quickly with these, the template is available on their website and is very easy to use.VALUE: You can make a lot of labels on just one sheet. If you usually order custom labels, these are much cheaper.  If you usually address items by hand, using these are much quicker.  They save you time and money.PERFORMANCE: The paper grabs the ink well and does not feather during printing, nor does it smear when you press them smooth with your finger onto an envelope.  They stick very well to letters and boxes. Also, they don't get jammed in the printer.APPEARANCE: Looks sharp and crisp.ADDITIONAL USES: We have a TON of books and loan them out often, putting one of these on the inside cover corner lets our friends know what books to return to whom.  Also good to put on the bottom of potluck dishes that get left behind, car key fobs for when you hand the mechanic your keys and on kids toys that go to friends houses with your little ones, just make sure your child is past the stage of trying to chew everything to avoid a choking risk.RATING: A+, highly recommend!I used these labels to print some return address labels. All in all they came out great, but had to waste a few sheets before I got them just right!I'm not sure if it was my printer or the labels, but the template that Avery told me to use was a tad off - some of the text got printed off the label. All I did was mess with the margins in MS Word a little bit, saved the template, and it ended up coming out quite nice.I do like the concept of the "Easy Peel" and it works pretty decently. I'd say someone with arthritis could benefit from this very much.I'm so happy that I don't have to write my address on all my outgoing mail anymore!I received both Avery # 8167 and #5267 to review.  Since they are identical (same specs and template number) but one is designed for an inkjet printer (8167) and one is for a laser printer (5267), I'll be posting the same review for both items.These Labels are designed with a "Pop Up" Edge.  This means that you bend the sheet at the side and the labels you want literally pop up an exposed edge so you can grab them easily.  Then you fold the sheet flat again.  As with most labels, you can get away with running the sheet through to print only a few labels and then rerunning a partial sheet for a second print of the remaining labels.  In my experience, each subsequent use of a partial sheet runs a greater risk of a jam though.  I'm sure Avery's "jam free guarantee"  would only apply to a print of a full page.These smaller size labels would also be useful for other applications-such as price tags at a garage sale...I've never found Avery to be anything but top of the line and this product is no exception.I wasn't sure I needed nor wanted the easy peel feature.  However, after mass labeling with more than 300 labels, I find the utility in its design.  It's only useful when labeling large numbers of envelopes at once; but I appreciated the convenience of having all the labels out and ready to go, not having to struggle to dig my nail under each on.My initial impression was that these labels were too small.  They are large enough to fit the average name and address on three lines in Times New Roman 8 point type.  They don't fit a fourth line, even when I tried changing to different typefaces.  If you need four lines, don't buy this.After using the labels, I found the size is actually appealing for my taste.  They are clean and simple and look appropriate on letter and business envelopes.  Larger envelopes or packages may need a more substantial size label.  Companies that want their label to stand out more may also opt for a larger size.Having moved recently, I needed some new address labels. I had always ordered address labels from those mail in label companies.  This is the first time I tried my own.  So did I think it was worth it?  DEFINITELY!!!  I can print sheet after sheet with a variety of pictures; I can change my pictures after a couple of months to reflect holidays, seasons, you name it!  The only complaint I have is that I would probably choose a bit larger size... these were a little small.  I used Avery's online printing program and it worked pretty good... not perfectly lined up, but after I adjusted it, it was fine.  For the price, you simply cannot beat it.  Highly recommend!!!!Avery sets the standard where it comes to address labels so this is a win-win purchase to consider. Get them. There are many address label companies but Avery is a home run every time, no matter what size label or need. Get them.I recently received these and finally had a chance to use them. I downloaded the template wizard for WORD and opened the program to quickly design and print out a sheet of labels.  I'm really pleased with how easy it all worked. Saves on the cost of ordering labels via a third party company.Unlike other return address labels, these Avery labels have an innovative "easy peel" feature that lets you fold back the perforation and remove the printed labels by just grabbing the exposed edge. It's so well designed, you wonder why nobody thought of this sooner.Designed specifically for inkjet printers, these labels print crisply, dry quickly, and avoid smudging.As many have noted, the small size of these labels doesn't leave much room for error on your printing software / printer driver / margin settings. You'll want to use the Avery template 5167 (free download from Avery, built into most other software including Microsoft Word) to start. Print a few sample pages on regular paper using your software and printer settings. Hold it up to the light with a blank label sheet in front to make any fine adjustments to margins.Note - the small size of these labels isn't for everyone - there's not much room for a custom graphic or logo. But that's why Avery offers multiple product choices!I find the Avery labels the easiest to use.  Every software package I've ever attempted has the Avery Label templates already built in, and the labels peel off easily, and stay stuck to the envelope during mailing.I like to use the Return Address size labels for many different uses: pricing items for a garage sale, file folders (yes, they make file folder labels, but I'm frugal), labeling books and DVDs, and I also would use them if sending bottles/baby items to a daycare facility.I am a very frugal shopper, but when it comes to labels I feel Avery's quality justifies the price.  I would recommend Avery brand labels to anyone!These are very high quality Return Address labels that can be printed with an Inkjet printer. I printed mine using a Lexmark X3350. There were no problems with the label sheet feeding through the printer. The labels hold the ink without smearing or blurring or bleeding. Furthermore, no labels detached from the sheet while moving through the printer - a disaster which has happened to me using lower quality labels. Yet they are easily peeled from the sheet when it's time to apply them.I strongly recommend that you investigate the "Design and Print Online" feature available on Avery's website. It is far more flexible than a simple template and you can save your layout for future use. The interface is a little strange and sometimes behaves in unexpected ways, but you'll easily enough get the hang of it with a bit of experimentation (and it has an "Undo"). I printed my first try on plain paper and then overlaid it on the label sheet to double check.I see that several of the reviews here criticize these for being unable to accommodate a 4-line return address. Using Avery's "Design and Print Online" you most certainly can create 4-line labels as follows: Find and start "Design and Print Online" on Avery's website. Enter the product number (8167) when prompted. Hit Next. Select the design you like (there are many to choose from). Important: select "Enhanced Editing." Hit Next. Select a 7-point font. Important: you want a fine, gracile font like Garamond. Enter the first 3 lines of your address in the text box and hit Return after the 3rd line. The Text Entry box will expand downward to fit a 4th line. Enter your 4th line text. Click outside the text-entry box and then position your cursor over the box and click once so you get the 4-way arrow that lets you move the entire text-entry box. Re-center vertically. You're done. Print and/or Save.Now, a 7-point font is kind of small. Your mail carrier will need his or her reading glasses. If your decision whether or not to purchase these is dependent on being able to do this, then you should try printing some 4-line, 7-point labels on plain paper and using Avery's website to verify that you like the way they look. It might be better to just go for a larger label. The point is, you can do 4 lines in a half inch with these if you want.The package contains 25 sheets of labels with 80 labels per sheet for a total of 2000 labels. If you are an individual rather than a business, that should keep you in labels until the year 2129.These work well and, combined with Avery's website, will allow you to create professional-looking, customized Return Address Labels so you can stop using the cheesy ones that your Insurance Agent sends you every Christmas.I received these Return Address labels shortly after I joined the Vine Review program.  I was interested to see if they would function as the package promised and they have!  Unlike other labels, I didn't have to struggle and swear while peeling them off the page to place on an envelope.  I'm looking forward to obtaining more when this package runs out.I get a lot of labels from Avery. I absolutely love that they make these return address labels so densely-packed and easy to peel. I can design my own return address label, use MS Word with an Avery template to print them out on my Inkjet printer, and have a whole sheet (or more) of them ready to use whenever I need them. No more ordering them from printing companies and then dealing with it when they screw it up or misspell something. With the Avery labels, I have total control over the way my return address label looks.As usual, with Avery you get quality labels that are reasonably price, come in a great arrangement, and have a strong adhesive on them. They work great for letters (snail mail) but are also useful for other things like labeling boxes or putting nameplates on your belongings at work ("This is MY manual, darn it!") I mean, really, these are just blank sticker arranged in a template-friendly layout. What you do with them is up to your imagination. You don't need to use them as return address labels at all... I'm sure you'll find something that needs a label on it, and these do the trick.What more is there to say? If you need labels, these are the best!These Avery return address labels are your normal, cute size labels.  They hold well but are not the type that is industrial strength strong.  It is possible to peel them off but they do not peel off as easily as repositionable labels.If you make your own return address labels, this is probably one of the most essential sizes of labels you will use.  I also like to use this size for making small labels for dating things I put in the freezer.These labels are too small for return address'.  They could work with postcards, but not much else.They print great with no jams in my printer. Easy to peal plus they stick very well to the packages I'm mailing. Avery definatly has a winner here with this product.Very easy to peel, just crease a 3rd section at a time and the edge of the label pops up.  Prints nicely, and looks good.  Appears to stick very well, and are not removable, so be sure you have the placement correct before sticking.These are general use return address/locate labels. .5 inch by 1.75. I checked MS word and MS works and Avery provided the Avery template numbers, so they worked well with all my applications without the need for me to download the templates from the the Avery website. And, of course, Avery was the industry leader in labels from the beginning, so you can not loose buying these.Way to go Avery. All your products I've purchased and used thus far are top quality, don't get stuck in my printer and adheres to the paper.These are the perfect labels for what they're intended for: return addresses. They are small. I didn't use them for mail merge or for different addresses. However they were perfect for making standard return labels with plenty of room for my address and a small logo. They printed without jamming, no errors, and smug free results. Printed hundreds of these for the holidays. Worked great. MS Word found the template without any problem.These are the size of those commercial address labels that you can order off of those inserts from Sunday newspapers. An A4 size paper has four columns of these labels. Three lines of text in font size 8, the smallest you can read without a magnifying glass, will fit on this label. So if your address has four lines, these won't work for you.They are not entirely removable because some adhesive comes off and then they do not stick as well the second time. Microsoft Word has templates for Avery size 8167 and 5167 and you can find other templates at Microsoft Office Online web site. Free software download is also available at Avery web site.I use them as return address labels and also to label electronic equipment like cell phone, iPad etc with name, email address and phone number in three lines of size 8 font. You can find other similar uses. They work well in laser printers too.The price of these address labels keeps changing but as of August 2010,3M Permanent Adhesive Return Address Labels, 1/2" X 1 3/4"  Inches White, Laser, 2000 labels per pack (3100-Q),3M Return Address Labels, White, 1/2-inch x 1 3/4-inch, 10 Sheets per Pack (3300-R) (800 total labels)are a littles less expensive. The real competition are the preprinted address labels from inserts in Sunday newspaper which come out far less expensive than these but then you cannot print them at your whim or personalize them.I have had bad experiences with "generic" printable labels in the past...namely, with the sheet getting stuck in my printer.  So far, I have had no problems at all with these labels, or any other Avery brand labels.  They go through the printer smoothly.  The labels are easy to peel off the sheet as well.Before purchasing, check the dimensions of the labels.  These particular ones are very small, but in turn you get more in the package.These work great as address labels, but I find other uses for them as well.  When I have pictures taken of my children, I've always written the name and date on the back of the photo before giving them to family.  This can get tedious when you are dealing with 40-50 photos to write on.  Now, I print out the relevant information on an address label, and affix that to the back of the photo.If you go online to the Avery website, there is a free software download that allows you to customize the labels to your liking.All around great company to buy any kind of paper product and after you buy it, they make sure that you buy some more because they have an online software suite that allows you to design and print the label and all of there other design-able paper products, I would give more stars if I could!These labels are of great quality.  No issues with avery design wizard of course.  Not a cheap label.  Good adhesive, nice heavy paper.It might seem silly to be excited about labels but I am. I've been looking for labels that aren't a pain in the you-know-what and I've found them.These labels are return address label sized (80/sheet). I'll be using them for that as well but my initial use is for "reorder" labels on products I sell. The printing is clear and smudge-proof, important for labels with small print that might be exposed to liquids or creams.What I like best about these is the Easy Peel feature, which will save much time and aggravation when I'm label several items (or envelopes) at once. I'll be ordering these again but with 80 labels per sheet, it may be a while.These are quality labels that yield a professional look. They also have a perforated backing paper that bends, making them easier to remove from the sheets. If you're looking for a really small no-nonsense label that sells with plenty in a pack, this product might be for you.However, I personally feel they're a little too small for practical use. It's difficult to fit more than three lines of text on this size label and still have it be large enough to read. The typical return address is three to four lines. The largest I can make the common font Times New Roman is 6.5 point in order to fit three lines of text on a label. Fitting four lines requires going down to only 4.5. (A typical font size is 10 to 12 point.)While there's nothing wrong with these labels, I prefer using shipping labels as return address labels. Using a larger-sized label allows users to fit four lines of text, a larger font size, or even a piece of clip-art. While this small size is functional and fuss-free, and one print yields an impressive 60 labels, legibility is sacrificed when labels are this small.These labels are a godsend for labeling and mailing things.  This 0.5" x 1.75" size is perfect for return addresses and small labels.  I prefer the 1" size for most things because of the larger size, but these work for smaller items.  I have used them to put my son's name on his school supplies, binders, etc. as well as for my things in the classroom like student names on cubbies, pencil cans, supplies in the storage cabinet.  Avery.com has templates that you can use and it does not take too much time to figure out how to print on them, so don't be scared.  2000 labels per package are just waiting for you!While address labels may not be the most interesting thing I buy, getting good labels that are easy to print does matter to me.  And the Avery White Easy Peel Return Address Labels 8167 were exactly what I was looking for.They truly are, as advertised, easy to peel off the backing.  And they don't smudge after being printed, nor do they jam in the printer.But for me, perhaps the most important thing about labels is the ease of using the printing website.  I found the Avery site easy to use.The bottom line?  Five stars.  Easy to print and use and economical.  Win win win.I bought the inkjet labels because I wanted to custom design my labels with colors using my inkjet printer.  In the past, the inkjet labels did not print as clear and tended to look "smudgy" or "blurry".  No more.  Avery has fixed this problem and now the labels print crisp.  I highly recommend them.Avery have literally set the standard for pre-cut adhesive peel-off labels and these are no different. Easy to remove from the backing (much easier than some other brands) and high quality paper and strong backing glue make these labels perfect for your label needs. I printed a bunch with a photo background and they look almost as good as a glossy print. Plus Avery always offers templates for the most used software packages (outlook, excel etc) so printing alignment and pre-filled info is handled for you so no need to perform multiple test prints before doing a proper print.It may seem like a simple thing to print onto labels but anyone who has used generic labels which don't conform to any standard will know just how many you can waste before everything is lined up. With Avery's labels the hard work is done for you and your labels will look perfect first time.As others have stated here, a label is a label is a label...right?  Not always.  There are many factors that I look at when buying labels, especially in quantity:1.  Price.  Big variances between 'generic' and 3M, Avery, etc.2.  Glue.  Good glue won't come through the label.3.  Adhesive Quality.  Labels shouldn't come off an envelope (which could result in a dead letter), and they shouldn't come off in the printer (which could result in the need for a new printer).4.  Ease of removing from sheet.  If they are not easy to remove, the label can be easily torn.  Sometimes I've had to use an X-acto knife to lift labels.Avery labels here are great value, and have the other characteristics of good labels.  Whenever I have a choice between an Avery label and another product (even at a much lower price) I buy the Avery.I use these exclusively as a return label set for my and for my parents who are getting old.  I print out a set every once in a while and I keep them on a clipboard.  Once a year I print out a few sets of these and mail them to my parents, whose eyes and arthritis make it a bit hard to do these things anymore and it's a tremendous help to them.  They are too small for the full address.I've also used them to label odd things.  Overall a great product.I will say that the easy peel adhesive works grreat on paper but don't try it on plastic.  I used them to label baby bottles and these did not peel off easily from plastic.  Magic on paper though.Avery has some of the best products, and this is one.  These labels are so easy to set up for printing your own labels.  I remember the old days of having to order labels from some company.  Now, you can do all that stuff yourself right at home.  As I mentioned, this is simple for anyone to set up.  The instructions are very clear on how to do this.Not only are these great for making your own return labels.  They are also handy for many different applications such as file folder labels, labels for kitchen items, yard sale price stickers, etc....These labels are great for use as a return address while mailing out your bills. I always intentionally put printed addresses and return addresses on anything I mail. Using labels that are printed on a computer printer keeps your mail on automation and out of the hands of humans. I've never had any mail lost because I use pre-printed labels. Avery labels are simply the best and these are the perfect size to use for a return address. Just load a full page into your printer (I have a laser printer) and print a full page at one time of perfectly printed labels to be used on your envelopes. These labels can also be printed individually and used on file folders or anything else that needs identification.These are a replacement product for the 5167 labels many of us have used succesfully for years.  I can't honestly say I ever found peeling labels from a backing sheet to be particularly challenging so, as far I'm concerned, the Easy Peel designation is a marketing gimmick.  They work just fine in myBrother HL2270DW laser printer, once I learned to orient the top of the sheet to the front of the paper tray in this printer.  That's a change from all the HP printers I've used in the past and had me thinking the formatting was off in Avery's Design Pro software.  Once I figured it out, the labels and the software are just what I needed.As with all Avery labels I have tried, these work very well. They print go through the printer without jamming, print cleanly, peel easily, and stick tightly.What more could you want? Highly recommended.What can I say about address labels?  These worked well in the laser printer, didn't jam and peeled off cleanly.  The type on the labels printed clearly too.  These will work well for return address labels.  They're too small for regular addresses.  As usual Avery has a quality product.I'm a regular user of other Avery products (address labels, return labels, etc) and I've never been disappointed.  These labels are no exception.  They come off the sheet easily, which prevents "dog-eared" labels.  Simple concept, but brilliant.  I'll look for these again in the future.I wasted several sheets of these labels because the text does not line up with the label.  Usually I print out a sample on plain paper and hold it up behind the sheet of stickers to see if the text and sticker line up properly.  I did do this once, but there is so much text, and the stickers are so small, that it was a waste of time.  I did have to adjust my document margin on top so everything would line up, but that was just guesswork.Then I noticed that on the label it says to "use template 5167".  So why are these stickers called 5267 labels?  What is the point of calling it that when you ultimately use a template with a different number?  That is a problem.  Then I dug out my other labels of the same size, also Avery.  The older package with the same feature of being "easy peel" is just called easy peel, whereas this one says it has a "pop-up edge".  We'll I don't see any difference between the two besides that there is label material in the middle of the page on the older one.  These labels have a space of no label material in the center, just the backing material.  With or without this sliver of material it works the same way.  Both are exactly the same size, and the space at the top of the label is the same also.  The older ones also say to use template 5167.  Even when I used the right template the text still did not line up on the label.  I also made the font smaller, as fonts can be called the same size, but actually be bigger or smaller.  I don't recall ever having so much trouble with this size label sheet.  I am using MS Word for Mac, but that shouldn't be an issue here.In any case, the labels themselves are fine.  They stick on things fine, and easily peel off the paper.  I would prefer a slightly larger label to use as return address labels.  This is just an annoying size to work with but if you must, then that's it.Avery makes excellent labels that do what they claim. They're high-quality and stick to what you put them on -- in this case, packages or envelopes. I'm taking away one star because they're harder to use in the printer than they should be. It's always a trick figuring out which way to orient the sheet and get it set up to print properly. Granted, part of that is my own fault. But these should be easier to use. However, overall it's a fine product.These are labels. They stick. You can print on them. They peel easily.  Not sure what else to say.  Avery always has the highest quality of labels and they're worth paying a little extra for.You can't use these for anything except return labels because they are so small. Be sure to position them where you want them the first time because if you don't & try to remove them to place them better they will tear & stick partially to the envelope. These did not jam even running through 100 pages at a time to print on my Konica Minolta laser jet color printer. I loved the online FREE help for getting the temp plate made & they also enclosed a toll free number to call for FREE help,can't beat that. I gave them 3 stars because of the help available, other wise I would have given them one star, the paper itself is very cheap.These are fantastic labels, just like the rest of the Avery line. I like that these are small - they have so many uses!  Will definitely purchase in the future.The Avery Easy Peel Return Address Labels work great in my Brother HL-2270DW laser printer.  It has yet to jam and does not smudge.  The 5267 return address label is supported natively in Microsoft Word, even in my old Office XP version.  If you prefer, you can download the Word template from Avery's website.  Why?  It's easier to use this template if you want to have different addresses on the same sheet.  Also, maybe you don't have Microsoft Office but have a compatible word processing program like WordPerfect or OpenOffice.The pop-up edge is a neat idea to allow for easy peeling though I really never had problems peeling the old style labels.  Labels aren't very exciting and there is only so much you can do to differentiate between one manufacturer's labels to another's.  However, the paper, adhesive, and the easy-peel feature on the Avery 5267 are all top notch and I have no complaints.  I typically buy office store-brand labels but these Avery's seem to have a better overall quality.2000 labels are a great deal but the 8000 label pack is even better, if you send out lots of mail.  Given that I only send out a few pieces of mail per month, these will probably last me several years.Though these labels are meant for laser printers, I was able to use them successfully with an inkjet printer. Just goes to prove the quality and flexibility of Avery brand labels! :)I think the Avery labels are superior to all of the off-brands that are out there (and I've tried several of those).  These labels do peel very easily and no Avery label (including these) has yet jammed any of my printers.  The paper quality (bright white and sturdy) is also quite nice.  Avery is always my first choice in printer labels!These labels print well in my HP LaserJet 3200, and they peel off easily, but they print a little too far down the page, as compared with the old model #5267 labels, and the top line of the label prints higher and higher as the labels go down the page, so about 1/4 of the labels at the bottom of the sheet have their top line cut off.  It may be that this is a printer issue, however.I have used Avery address labels in the past and love their templates for large mailings.  The easy peel feature improves the old labels.  I highly recommend these.I have grown to trust the Avery name represents "Quality".  Avery again fulfilled all expectations for a great product that prints without jamming (I found one mfr who's labels sometimes come off inside my laser printer...), looks great AND meets all requirements for a great product.  I love the fact I can print easily within MS Word 2010/2011 with peace of mind.  Additionally, Avery's website features templates and easy to print methods online without having to download software.  Avery gets another gold star in my book!In particular, these smudge free labels are the perfect size for return address labels, 35mm slides, labeling the backs of photographs, labeling the inside of books with the owner's information (such as a return address label format), etc. I use this size label for labeling canning jars, packets of herbs and seeds as well as labeling the clear drawers in my husband's electronic parts bins.Tips: I often will print one sheet to standard copy paper FIRST, then verify my page lines up correctly with the label sheet PRIOR to printing and wasting an entire sheet of labels, needlessly. Another option is to print on the BACK of the labels first, align, then print on the correct side of the page.These are the perfect address labels that are small enough to fit the return forms I deal with each month,so I don't have to use my hideous handwriting to fill out the forms.I also enjoy the seasonal templates they have free at the Avery website for downloading that add holiday fun to my letters,Another reason I prefer the Avery labels is the great "Pop-up Edge" they have added,which makes the fast peeling of labels very quick & easy,when doing a stack of mail,After years of using an ink-jet printer, I finally bought an economical laser printer.  These laser labels are perfect for the kind of labels that I keep handy - a few dozen printed labels for each family member, and my own return labels.I had no problem running these through my Brother laser printer, using Word 2011 for Mac, template 5267.  Avery is always worth the extra money! Their quality is outstanding, and this product is no different.  The labels don't jam, they line up properly, and they peel easily.  In other words, they work well, and they don't annoy me when I go to use them, and that is something I look for in a product I pay a premium for.  Avery is my go-to for printer products -- worth the few extra cents (or even a dollar) because I know it will get the job done over the months the packet will be in my desk drawer.I just recently got my first laser printerBrother Printer HL2270DW Wireless Monochrome Printer(with which I am very happy, I find it works exponentially faster and more efficiently than ANY ink printer I have owned) and then these labels came up, which I thought was the perfect test for my new printer!Essentially, they print up great, and of course it will vary from printer to printer, but I didn't have any issues with these, smearing or getting caught or anything of the like.  If you are looking for return address labels for a laser printer, then these work extremely well, and are priced at the same as just about any other pack of address labels; they are worth it.  :)God Bless ~AmyI've used this exact Avery label for years as our return address label.  I got this particular pack free through the Amazon Vine program in exchange for writing a review of the product.These labels are the perfect size for return addresses, and they are super easy to print using an Avery template or one that comes with your MSWord program. The adhesive is strong so they stay securely stuck to your envelopes.  The "easy peel" part of the name means they peel easily off the backing sheet when you bend it.  With 2000 labels in each pack, you'll be all set to send out those bills, letters and Christmas cards.It is so easy to use these laser printer labels. There's a pre-loaded template in Word (you just have to select the item #), and they print clean and clear, and peel and stick easily. Just what we need in our busy lives -- simplicity!These are everything you could want in printable address labels.  Easy to use, set up, and print.  And it's a good price for a good number of labels.We go through a pack roughly every month or two in our office (small insurance agency).  Avery makes some of the best office products, and these are no exception!These labels are great. They line up perfectly in Microsoft Word, and they print right every single time. Use them constantly.I have been using these labels for organizing and mailing my graduate school application materials.  They work perfectly in conjunction with Microsoft Word and my small HP P1000 Laser Jet printer. As other reviewers have noted, they are easy to peel and apply firmly to most surfaces. Highly recommended for their ease of use and professional, clean look. A+Another great product by Avery.  These labels are extremely easy to use and they don't smear in my laser printer.  And by using the template software that Avery has (DesignPro) it is extremely easy to make your own designs.  I will buy again.These are excellent.  Like most Avery labels, no smudging, easy to work with.  Worked great with my laser printer. I recommend all Avery products...at least the many that I have used so far!Return address labels save you time, and the Avery system is easier-to-use than many.These labels perform exactly as described. They feed perfectly, are perfectly spaced on the label sheet, are easy to peel and position, and they can be repositioned many times yet still stick firmly.For those not familiar with how easy these Avery labels work:You simply open a Word DocumentClick on Envelopes and LabelsSelect Avery Label 5267Type in what you want on the labeland Print.The label sheet even shows you which end to insert in your printer.In a couple of seconds you have great-looking return address labels.I received both Avery # 8167 and #5267 to review.  Since they are identical (same specs and template number) but one is designed for an inkjet printer (8167) and one is for a laser printer (5267), I'll be posting the same review for both items.These Labels are designed with a "Pop Up" Edge.  This means that you bend the sheet at the side and the labels you want literally pop up an exposed edge so you can grab them easily.  Then you fold the sheet flat again.  As with most labels, you can get away with running the sheet through to print only a few labels and then rerunning a partial sheet for a second print of the remaining labels.  In my experience, each subsequent use of a partial sheet runs a greater risk of a jam though.  I'm sure Avery's "jam free guarantee" would only apply to a print of a full page.These smaller size labels would also be useful for other applications-such as price tags at a garage sale...I've never found Avery to be anything but top of the line and this product is no exception.Excellent labels. They adhered themselves to my envelopes like little soldiers...just as if their tiny little label lives depended on it...which, I suppose, they did.  There is room to write even the most pretentious European address, where they add all kinds of extra lines just to show off that they are in Europe, when we in America, the largest God Given Land Mass in The Continental World Of Its Kind, need just 3 lines.Does it mean we are better than those who live overseas?  Maybe.  And we don't have to talk with those fancy accents either, or in those foreign languages.  What's with them? When did they start with that? Do they think they are too good to speak English? Which is the language used in the Bible, so are they sending a message that way, too? Like to Satan or his mignons????BAnyway that is for each of us to determine in his or her own heart,and we are not here to talk about the snide, red-tinged and possibly devil worshiping Europeans, but about these Avery Labels, so let us return to our subject.  But you must admit, speaking a foreign language AND using more than 3 lines in an adress is just putting it on that one layer too thick.  .Okay, here we are, back to the labels again.  What makes Avery 1/2 X 1 3/4 Laser Printer Labels one notch better than your label (and certainly your inferior European label), what takes them to that semi-mythical Uber-label pantheon, is the stick up edge. You know when you have ten million labels to stick on envelopes and you try bending the page so the labels are easier to pull off,but some bend and some don't, and a couple even bend too far so they get stuck to themselves and you have to sneaky throw them away so no one will see?  Well finally somebody twigged to the need for a bent edge label and here it is.The bent edge does not make sticking labels on envelopes any less miserable, time-consuming and tedious a job, one more suited to, say, the Europeans. Labelling is awful work, particularly when one does it in one's office where one cannot turn the TV set on to watch Judge Judy, but the Avery Labels have that bent edge, a new High Tech Cutting Edge Design Element that makes the job go a little bit faster and every little bit helps.  And if you want to know why, at my age, my job still entails sticking labels on envelopes, it's because Shut Up.The labels are fine - they peel and stick with ease. However, I wasted a few sheets because the print would not line up properly. The instructions say to use Avery template 5267 but this does not work. After some experimenting and waste of product, I found that 5167 works the best.Another good one from Avery. I'm never disappointed with Avery labels or other products, though I confess that Staples brand (when it's available) can be significantly cheaper with no apparent loss of quality.These are good, standard solid LASER labels from Avery - template suggestions are always on the package (so helpful) and I've used the 3M version, Avery version, and branded store versions (like Office Depot) - they all work well as address labels - if you are wondering how to choose, I'd make your decision based on price, and features such as the Easy Peel (which makes using a LOT of these go much faster - think Christmas card mailings, wedding/shower invitations, etc)...as well as other features like (is it for a LASER or INKJET) printer?  [this is for LASER printers]Is it the right adhesive (does it stick well enough to the type of envelopes or packages you are using)...I would recommend this product from Avery - price and a few other features will help you make a quick decision between this & other brands, but Avery has been making good labels for a long time, so I would choose Avery where I could - I like their continuous improvement process!  Great labels, good size (I like these smaller address labels for return address labels) - would recommend!This item works great.  Edge sticks up for easy peel.  Sticks very permanent, make sure you have it where you want it before you stick, as there will be know removing and re-sticking.  Prints through your laser printer good.I'm glad that so many people have been pleased with this product. I have a few gripes, so I guess I'll stand as the devil's advocate review today, which is rare for me.The labels themselves were of great quality, never jammed or peeled in the printer, and the way you get the labels off of the paper by folding it is ingenious and better than I've seen elsewhere.  That being said, all I wanted was a simple way to put my return address on the labels.  The issues that I had mostly revolve around the software.1.  The web based printing is simple & easy... it creates PDF's that you download and print.  I had issues getting things to line up though, so I wasted about 50% of the labels on each sheet.  I wasn't being that picky-- as long as everything was on the label, and nothing was on a label from an adjacent label, I considered the label a "win"-- even if not centered. Still, I lost about 50% of them.2.  I downloaded the full version of Avery software from the company-- for free! I was happy with that, and expected it to be basic.  But at least at the time of this review, product 5267 was not listed in the software so I couldn't use the software.3.  Take me to the third & final option-- support for Microsoft Word.  I have word 2010 and figured that would be the best bet.  After downloading the Avery software for Office 2010, it wouldn't install... I use Windows 7 64 bit and Office 64 bit, so the software wasn't compatable.So all of that being said, I'm glad so many others have had such great success with the labels. I had hoped that the Avery Stand Alone software was going to be the key to success for me as it also supposed print alignment testing, however, the lack of support for this particular label was the final thing to run me off track.I hope some of these "gotchas" are helpful to some of you using Windows 7 64 bit or really care about print alignment.I gave it 3 stars because really, even with the label waste on option 1, the ones I did get that were ok enough were good enough to fill my need of return labels.  If I really needed tons of labels and spent more time tweaking and wasting more sheets, there is a good chance I could achieve less waste. And I may try that again.Update! Success! Sort of.... Word 2010 has some built in default label printing functionality and this label is one of the options.  I don't have the nice photo options and it still took some wasting of a few sheets, but I was able to get a full sheet of return address labels with no "wasted ones!"My family and I recently moved into a new home and I needed some easy/inexpensive return address labels. These Avery labels were easy to use in my home printer using the template they recommended. Super duper easy to peel off and use. I don't think I'll have to buy return address labels for a looooong time since the pack comes with 2,000 of them!These are nice labels and will work for most purposed. However, for my application, I need to fed one sheet multiple times, as I use labels on items that I craft. Unfortunately, with these Avery labels, after I feed them a couple times, the adhesive seems to bleed through and the label turns a bit brown. I am using a HP laserjet, but I have had this problem before with the lower end labels. The more expensive labels don't have that problem.So, if you plan to print one sheet at a time, this should be fine. If you plan to print only a few labels at a time, look for another product.There's really not a lot to say about these labels. They do exactly what I want them to do. I got them to use for return address labels, and for that they are perfect. They are just the right size, and they print well. You could also use them for the main address label if your recipient's address is short enough.Recommended.I tried the new Avery laser printer labels with the "Pop-up Edge" and found them easy to use.  The die-cut labels fed well through my HP laser printer, stuck well on envelopes and packages, and didn't smear.  These labels may also be written on by hand when called for which is a useful benefit.  The "Pop-up Edge" is a feature which allows you to fold the sheet so one edge lifts, making it easy to peel the label from the sheet.  The center "margin" has also been removed to facilitate easier removal compared to earlier products.  I found this "Pop-up" to be a double edged sword so to speak as once the labels are "popped-up," I found that they don't quite go back to flat.  The feature is good if you are printing a whole sheet but I sometimes print individual labels which means the popped label is a potential jam in the printer.I found that the Avery labels get the job done which earns them 4 stars.  Compared to the 3M labels however, the Avery labels are more expensive and I do not think the "Pop-up Edge" is as effective as 3M's "Quick Lift Design."I am always amazed how these things survive my laser printer without peeling off.  After that they're pretty much just labels, they hold ink and stick to things.  So if you like the price and need labels, order them :)Comfortable to use with the keyboard. It is ergonomically good to have one. Supports your wrist.We love it, no more wrist pain.Cheap and it does the job.I have two of these, end to end, across the front of my desk.I've used them for about a month and notice a positive difference in how my hands and wrists feel at the end of a work day.The bottom is reasonably grippy and stays in place, while not &#34;adhering&#34; itself to the desk top.Bought for work where the computer setup was not comfortable. These reduced my wrist pain.I'd recommend this item. I just got it to replace one I had for about 7 years. This is very nice and durable. I was very impressed and the price can't be beat.No major complaints! It does it's job at work and has helped me reduce any joint pain when I type at work!  I loved the color and the price.  It came very quickly. Would recommend to a friend.Belkin Wrist Pad is a great support for all people who spend lot of time working with their keyboards that will help your wrists and hands don't get tired so much.It's lightweight, very comfortable, ergonomic product and it's made asymmetrical that is great for me because position of hands during keyboard use isn't the same.The pad is filled with gel making it adjustable to your own hands thus providing great support.I like keyboard wrist pads that aren't combined with mouse pads because that allows user to combine position of keyboards and mouse in a way that is convenient to the user, but also making it suitable for both left-handers and right-handers.Since I use it for a month I cannot yet speak about its durability though it's looking like a lasting product that doesn't wear a lot during use.Overall, this Belkin Wrist Pad would be my first recommendation if you are searching for good wrists support being in front of the computer for a whole day.I purchased 3 of these for coworkers who wanted better ergonomics. The wave wrist rest functions well and available here on Amazon for a good price. It is contoured which makes it more comfortable and the width is perfect for tight placement.My wife was having soreness in her wrists that may have signaled the onset of carpal tunnel syndrome. I ordered the Belkin Wave Rest wrist pad, and since she started using it, the soreness has subsided. She loves the pad. It's about an inch wider than the keyboard she's using, so she doesn't have to move her hands off the pad. I've used it a few times, and I liked it enough that I may get one for myself.I think the wrist pad is worth trying for anyone who may be developing carpal tunnel syndrome or any related problem.only .5" high not 1"fabric is not durable, wears through and hard to keep cleanother than obvious lack of function due to height, no leaks, does not stiffen up over timeInnovera is a better brandThe gel rest is comfortable.  However if you look at the picture closely, the pad is actually a bit thinner 4/3rd of the way to the left, I think the designer's ideal is to make the thickest part near the number pad on the right side..But the problem is that number pad is least used part of the keyboard, and when my hand rest on &#34;F&#34; and &#34;J&#34; key the right side gets a lot less coverage than the left side, and feel very unbalanced.works well.  user(s), however, should position their hands, chair height, lumbar support, take frequent breaks etc, for optimal ergonomics & minimizing repetitive injuries.The wrist pad I brought a couple of months ago had a terrible smell when I purchased it and the smell is still there but not as strong. Now the gel is coming out at the seams.  I cannot use the wrist rest and I tried to fix it but it cannot be fixed.  I would not recommend this item.I purchased this product so I can use it at work. It is very comfortable and the price is affordable.This is an excellent product!  No issues with this and is consistent with the described purpose.  Fills the needs for the intended purpose.There isnt much this has to do other than be in the right position to rest my wrists on it. It does that.Bright, easy to use, and worked as intended without a flaw. Avery has always made quality office products (I used to sell them years ago) and these labels are no diferent.  Print away!These labels are perfect for many uses.  I use them for shipping labels and for labeling items that I am storing. Also, I am using them as gift labels for packages for the poor for Christmas.  With the easy to use template, you can decorate these labels to make pretty tags that stick and don't come off. Avery labels are great!Love these I've been busy shipping many things so these are so wonderful to use. I've also used them in my address book--updated everyone's info and it looks so nice typed and on these great labels.I love Avery labels! Their free templates are easy to find and download. The labels print flawlessly every time. And they are durable. I really can't say enough about these terrific time savers. I design my own return address labels with a family portrait on them, I print out address labels for my holiday cards, and I print larger labels for packages, all with ease! If you are looking for high quality labels that won't let you down, Avery is the way to go...Trublock Technology is a gray coating on the adhesive side of the label so that it is more opaque and covers what is underneath. If this is important to you than it's an added bonus. Otherwise, not an essential quality.These labels are what I have needed for years. We are always returning items and also often sell items on ebay. I have actually put together 2 small labels all these years. Finally, I can now print the labels from my computer and easily attach to the packages. Thanks, Amazon.I have been using the Avery Shipping Lables for years for my buisness.  They work out beautifully!  Easy to format on word and other programs.  I use these as shipping lables but they are great for other things too!  I have used them to put labels on a small bag of popcorn.  I have used them to place on the kids gift bags for birthday parties!  So many uses for them!love the size so you can write or type big for the adddress and looks so professional rather than just writing on the envelope. Sometimes I write them out by hand and other times I print them out on my laser jet printer so I can do different colors. Turns out great every time and no getting stuck or labels coming loose while printing. Feeds easily through the printer.These 2 x 4 labels are a nice size not only for covering previous labels on packages but also for adding a larger font when printing out labels and there is enough room to add an image/design.  I would order this larger size label again. They were packaged well and arrived within the two day delivery time.These labels worked great. I needed 190 and bought these and they work great. They print easy, the template in MS Word (I have MS Office 2000) worked like a champ. No complaints at all.I give these labels my highest recommendation as I like to recycle packaging (envelopes, boxes, plastic mailers) and they are sufficiently thick so that you only need one to cover up any addresses, codes, instructions that would ordinarily make it hard to reuse packaging. Even if you tend not to be a person who recycles, these will serve you well in case you need to return a purchase using the same package that it came in.Easy to peel and can be used for addressing using computer software or just as good to peel off and write over them by hand. Priced reasonably and there is little else to say about "labels." If you need them, these are as good as it gets for the reasons highlighted above.If you use labels exclusively for mailings on new envelopes, you might be able to save a few dollars and buy another Avery product that has more labels for a similar price.My HP 460 inkjet printer can print on these without any problems.  The pages feed into the printer smoothly and the ink doesn't smudge after printing.  Avery also provides plenty of software templates on their website for you to use.  Just go to [...] and search for 5163 (this information is on the label packaging too).  They provide many premade label designs in Word Doc format and blank templates for other applications like InDesign and Photoshop.  Also, the TrueBlock feature really does block out everything behind the label, which is great when you're reusing old boxes for shipping.  Overall, I'm very happy with these labels.I have reviewed several label products in the past, and have always found Avery to create a quality product, which does everything it says it will do, and will make you look fabulous and resourceful in the office, which can't hurt at employee review time.  :-)  These labels are no exception.  They have permanent sticking power and are a strong enough white that nothing will show through the label.  This is important now that so many companies are trying to be green by recycling old shipping cartons. If your company doesn't do this yet, suggest that they do so.  It will save them money (green!) when they don't buy new shipping cartons and reduces the cost of waste removal (more green!).  AND, it keeps cartons out of landfills, which is the greenest part of the whole deal.Back to the labels.  A while back, I reviewed some labels that had Microsoft Word templates you could load onto a computer and design the labels of your dreams.  I commented that most companies have rules against anyone but the IT department loading software onto their computers, which made the software less than practical for the people who use these at work.  Avery has now solved this problem:  they still offer the Microsoft word uploads, but you can also go to their web site and design the labels of your dreams without putting anything on your work machine. I tried the Microsoft Word add-on software and was impressed by the results.My project was to pack up some old summer clothes in old copy paper boxes, labeling each box top and bottom so that they could be retrieved easily.  Copy paper boxes are printed with many dark colors and graphics, and if the label was going to have a show through problem, this was the time for it.  The no show through technology worked like a charm - nothing shows through onto the face of the label, and it's a cinch to find my "outgrown bathing suits - won't fit again in this lifetime."Why four stars instead of five?  Because they're labels, not a cure for cancer.  I like the labels, but it's not like we're going out or anything.  :-)I used these as name tags in my classroom on folders. I also used them on boxes that I packed away for future use. I mailed a present to my sister in another state with some of them. They have worked great for all three purposes. They stick well and don't peel up around the edges. The markers (sharpie type) don't bleed on them. They are very effective for many purposes besides just shipping. And they do a great job for their main purpose as well.I send lots of gifts to my out-of-state grandchildren, and I love to reuse boxes I already have -- think of all the stuff Amazon sends you (what a perfect way to save a tree by recycling boxes)!One of the drawbacks of reusing boxes is that you will have to scribble out all the previous markings from the box.  Not so with these labels with TrueBlock Technology!  They have a gray coating on the back of each label, which efficiently hides even the darkest marks, even on white boxes.The only drawback is that the gray coating makes these labels "less sticky," making me wonder if they might peel off the package in transit.  To prevent this, I put clear tape on all sides of the label (just to be safe), and it's a small inconvenience, because I don't have to spend tons of time scribbling out all the markings when I send gifts to my grandchildren any more.One more benefit...  These don't "hang up" in my HP Photosmart inkjet printer, and (as long as I don't run a wet finger through the fresh ink) the ink doesn't smear.I used these for two reasons - to print addresses for shipping padded envelopes and to help label and organize my bathroom closet.They were perfect for both.The address labels were printed on an inkjet printer which I thought would smear but they came out fine. I used the standard paper setting and didn't have to fiddle with the gloss or stock weight settings at all. The colors looked nice on there, too. They were affixed to those brown padded envelopes and they stuck on really well. They are sticky and re-positionable but ONLY if you pull it off very quickly. Great size - fit full addresses with room to spare.Then, I used a Sharpie to write names on the stickers to match up with the little organization bins I have in my bathroom closet and that worked great, too. The sharpie marker looks fantastic on the matte surface.I will use these again!What can I say? Avery makes great labels. These are my favorite size, and I love that they block out what's underneath so I can reuse shipping envelopes.I bought for the purpose of placing a printed label in a small address book.  This works perfect and by using printed labels you names and address etc... are easy to read and legible, also if someone moves, just place a new label over top, possibly you might be able to remove the old one.  I have not tried that yet though.When a template works, it's great. This time... it all worked out. Adhesive, easy to use. Worked well for labels on envelopesThese 2 X 4 inch white shipping labels are just the right size for most mailings.  250 labels in the compact sleeve holder.  The smaller sized ones don't give you enough room to print out the address comfortably.  They pull off the backing, and are self-stick adhesive, and they stay stuck onto the front of the envelope without any problem.Don't waste your money on the smaller sized ones, get these instead.Highly recommended.The Avery labels have been around for a long time now and work as well as ever.  I was pleased with the value of this package.  It was becoming hard to find the plain 2X4 labels and there's enough in the pack to last me a long time.I've never had a complaint about Avery labels. By the way, here is another use I found for them. My wife is filling in as teacher for a class of 4-year olds. There are more kids than swings at recess, and this was causing fights and discontent. Now the kids get "swing tickets" printed on Avery labels (kids LOVE stickers) and based on their good behavior. So far, she says it's worked wonders.I received this through the Amazon vine program.  These labels are heavy grade of paper that will completly cover any errors that you might have made on a previous label as long as this label size is the same as your original label.  The package contains a link to a format you can use with Word that allows you to print labels that conform to the sheets you have.I have a Kodak ink printer and I had absolutely no problems feeding the sheets through it.  I was able to refeed the sheets easily if I did not use all of the labels the first time.The adhesive on the labels holds well and I have had no problem.I would highly recommend these labels for normal and for corrective labeling.I bought these labels for two reasons; one, to use as shipping labels; second, for labelling my DVD storage cases. The 2 x 4 inch size is large enough for the addresses or the movie/TV title, and they stick very well; the application is easy and fast.  The labels are bright white and well designed with a professional appearance. The labels have a grey blocking layer that covers any writing or printing underneath.I print the title of the movie or TV show and stick it to the cover of DVD storage cases. It is easy to print on these labels from my laser printer. They are of good quality and they are reasonably priced. I have rated these labels four stars for the design, quality and overall satisfaction.These are good, standard solid INK JET labels from Avery - template suggestions are always on the package (so helpful) and I've used both the 3M version, Avery version, and branded store versions (like Office Depot) - they all work well as address labels - if you are wondering how to choose, I'd make your decision based on price, and features such as the TrueBlock Technology included on these (which makes using a a recycled box or envelope much easier - it's thicker and truly covers up the older used labels below!)...as well as other features like (is it for a LASER or INKJET - this is for INK JET printers - believe me, it does make a difference!  It affects the ink, smudging, smoothness, finish, etc.) printer?  Is it the right adhesive (does it stick well enough to the type of envelopes or packages you are using)...I would recommend this product from Avery - price and a few other features will help you make a quick decision between this & other brands, but Avery has been making good labels for a long time, so I would choose Avery where I could - I like their continuous improvement process and the way I can re-use old boxes for mailing with these!  I am a bigger fan of Laser printers than Ink Jet, but I have one of each, and these work great in the Ink Jet printer!These labels from Avery work pretty much as advertised.  The dark gray backing does an excellent job of covering up whatever is underneath the label.  The size is perfect for packages, and they don't smudge easily.  I just wish the adhesive was a little bit stronger.  These labels can be peeled off without much effort, which is great if your recipient wants to reuse the box, but not so great if you want to ensure that the label stays put and can't be removed.  An easy solution (though perhaps not very elegant) is to cover the label with clear packing tape.Overall I like these labels, and I think the price is reasonable.  Perhaps in the future Avery will come out with an extra-strong/permanent version of these, which I would gladly give five stars.These Avery shipping labels are easy to use. The 2 x 4 inch size is large enough for both the to: address and a return address. They stick very well. The labels make it easy to reuse boxes and large envelopes because they have a gray blocking layer that covers any writing or printing underneath.I've had no trouble using my ink-jet printer to print the labels and the Avery templates make it snap to produce professional looking results.There are a lot of options when it comes to labels and it can be hard to pick one that is best.  Although placing a normal label on a surface with writing covers most of it up, these ensure that it does.  I tested several and they do work well.  These labels are great for packages and are the type I use most often.As for the stickiness of these labels, I would say they are about average.  They are probably not going to fall off in transit, but can peel off mostly clean or completely clean on the surface they were attached to.  Overall, these are good labels, but there isn't a whole lot of difference between them and others.Excellent cover up's for your mis-printed envelopes.  The perfect size to cover up most addresses.  Sticks well, prints excellent.  Removes from the sheet easily.These are general use return address/locate labels. 2 inch by 4 inches.  I checked MS word and MS works and Avery provided the Avery template numbers, so they worked well with all my applications without the need for me to download the templates from the the Avery website. And, of course, Avery was the industry leader in labels from the beginning, so you can not loose buying these.  And the TrueBlock really works.  I took one of the blank labels and pasted it on the dark blue folder the lables come in.  No blue shows through, it is pure white..It's environmentally friendly to reuse packaging material, but it can be annoying when you try to cover up or tear up old labels.  The Avery TrueBlock Technology comes to the rescue.  It's a time saver and frustration free solution.These labels are excellent.  They feed well and don't smudge.  Standard size and very useful.  What more could you want?I'm a label lover. My cranky old inkjet has started chewing up the occasional label sheet, but for whatever reason, these go through without a hitch. I use them for more than shipping, no home office can be without these.Avery is a brand I trust  I have tried other but not sure of names they did not stand up to the quality of Avery Labels.  They fit my files great and last for years.  I would recommend to friends.  I have been in my own business for 5 year, But used them in other companies  prior.I always used avery for mailing and shipping labels, and these are the larger sized ones for boxes, etc.  Like them.The easy-peel feature makes it easier to get the labels off the sheet. You bend the page in half and then back again. The product is fool-proof. The tricky parts are doing the mail merge into the word processor.The templates come with Microsoft Word and WordPerfect.  At the website they have templates for image processing software, too.If you have a specific question, make a comment and I will figure out the answer.I've been using Avery labels for my label needs for many years.  The best thing about Avery labels that they stick on very well, smoothly, without puckers. I use the lables also with the colored ink jet printer and black and white laser printer. The paper quality is good and there is no blurring of ink when used with ink jet printers. Laser printer results are excellent as well.I usually do need to print a huge number of labels and can't fill the entire sheet. However I found that I can reliably print the labels on the sheet in two several passes, even when some labels were alredy peeled off. o avoid labels sicking to the printer I flip the sheet and have the part that has no peeled labels go first. This really helps me to save money and only print what I need without waste.Avery redesigned the label sheet to reduce wasted paper. Avery has eliminated the paper between the row of the labels.  Despite less of a hold on the labels I am still able to feed the paper through twice as described above.There is a large variety of free templates for use with Avery labels, all you need to know is the number of the label to get the right template.  Using templates I get perfect results with several different word processors - no waste, all labels get printered and perfectly aligned.You can't go wrong with Avery labels.Ali Julia reviewRarely does a company claim something is improved that actually is better, but this is one of those rare occasions.  The simple lack of paper in between the columns of labels does wonders for the ease of peeling off a label.  Why this isn't a common practice for all printable stickers is the real question.  No more bending the paper to peel one off.  On my inkjet printer the printed labels look wonderful as far as colors and clarity.  With the template I was able to customize several mailing labels for different seasons and different addresses.  The labels affix to envelopes easily and I haven't noticed any peeling.  I have only used the labels on regular envelopes, so I don't know how they would hold up on any other type of packaging (such as padded envelopes), but will update if I ever find out.  The labels could have been a little longer to allow for a longer address in larger fonts or a small picture/clip art, but I still was able to put a small jack-o-lantern in front of my friend's address when sending her a Halloween card (only really sent her one so I could use more labels just for fun).  I just had to use a smaller font next to the clip art, but it still is a good size.Word of caution:  Depending on your printer, the printing may be off center or higher on the label than expected.  I'm almost positive this is my printer because I have had this issue with mailing seals as well, but just wanted to advise others to check this before printing many labels.I like using Avery labels because the templates never fail.  These address labels are easy to peel off and work well for mail merges.I figured these labels would be comparable with other Avery labels. these are truly smudge free and easy to peel off....no rips or tears from the sheet.Haven't felt well so I haven't used it yet a lot of times you send the reviews too sone for me to have used the productMade stickers for out gift boxes for our wedding. We printed them ourselves and they turned out great. Recommend this product.I have been using Avery labels for many years and feel you can't beat their quality.  They stick very well but peel off easily when necessary.  I have tried other brands that have been on thinner paper but have found the Avery to be the best, although the price is comparable.  For anyone who needs peel off address labels this is the one for you.Avery labels are an outstanding product and these labels have a Pop-up Edge to make peeling easy. I often tug at a label, insert my fingernail or knife under one attempting to release it, sometimes tearing the label. These labels eliminate these hassles. A bonus is that if your word processor software doesn't have a template for them, you can download it on Avery's website. I like the size of these labels, too.I have used different labels over the years and it is difficult to compete with the reliability of Avery labels.  They are the &#34;cheapest&#34; brand around but they are consistent each and every time.  I will keep on buying them.I have used Avery Labels for years and all I can say is they are still the only game in town when it comes to ease of use, quality and getting the job done on a standard ink jet printer. I can't remember an Avery Label coming off.Something I really like is there whiteness and the contrast with ink jet black. As stated they are truly easy to peel.Don't you hate it when you have to pick and pick at the corner of a label....  Avery's Easy Peel Address Labels are very easy to peel... They are a bit thinner than the Avery Repositionable labels, but still very strong. Very easy to print on and the ink - no matter the color shows up great... Be sure the check out avery's website for templates and more...Like most pieces of paper in a printer when you want it line up with something it is hard.  These labels worked perfectly and stuck on envelopes without issues.  They stick very well and if you need to remove one either don't put it on fully or just put another one over it since it isn't coming off.I'll keep this review brief:These labels are very nice. Convenient to use with my inkjet printer, and getting the template for printing them is a snap. You just go to avery.com/templates, then select 'templates' from the left, then go to the 'address labels' menu, then pick the 'clear - 30 per sheet' template that works with your word processing program (I use Word). From Word, it was as simple as selecting Open --> navigating to the template on My Documents, then filling it out and printing normally.The only thing for me is that I don't typically send to the same address a lot of times, so I won't be going through these too quickly. I do my bills and stuff online now, so... the days of needing address labels are coming to an end (for me).Still, you get a bunch of easy-to-print labels for about a cent each. Saves you time messing with a pen and could be very useful for when you're sending out invitations for which you have the addresses of the invitees on your computer and don't want to bother writing out a bunch of labels.These are just that I needed. I love the convenience of just pushing a button at work and having supplies like these delivered before I would have had time to go get them.I know it's hard to get excited about mailing labels, particularly if you do not do any broadcast mailings.  But, these labels are easy to use with MS Word templates.  But unless you are going to have a printer that serves only as a label printer, if you have only one or two labels to print, you will save time by writing them by hand because there is some setup time.  As long as you have names and addresses stored in Word, and do not have to take time to add new addresses for a particular mailing, I think three labels is the point where you start saving time by printing them on your printer.There is really nothing special about the labels, the adhesive is good and evenand the paper is bright white.  I could have given these labels a 5 star rating but Amazon's description of 5 stars is "I Love It".  While I can think of no way to improve upon this product, I cannot save "I love it" with any sincerity, hence, the rating of 4 Stars.I've used Avery labels for years and been very satisfied.  The new easy-peel feature makes these the best yet!We use address labels for mailing, for party invitations, for labeling the kids play bins and folders - all sorts of things. These slightly thicker labels are great, they feed through the printer without any problems (I'm using an HP D7360) and line up perfectly for my templates. With the normal style of Avery label I tend to pull off the outer grid, then raise each sticker one at a time - this can lead to wrinkled edges that don't stick as well. These new pop-up labels really do peel off easily and without edge damage but they don't come apart while printing. (I was afraid they would get stuck inside the printer - didn't happen). Definitely worth getting again and has a nice crisp appearance. I did see another reviewer had trouble with them sticking to poly bubble envelopes - with all my labels (except those on paper envelopes) I tend to cover them with a piece of clear tape, so I don't know if that is an issue or not. I did use them on that type of envelope, but with the tape applied as well.Updated 6/3/2012 - As these labels have aged they have developed some issues that make me reluctant to leave them with a 5 star rating. the adhesive has gotten less tacky, I now see more of the peeling the other reviewer reported. Equally annoying is a failure of my printer to recognize that these are printable. Because the easy peel has areas near the top that are not covered in label, my printer spits every fifth or sixth sheet out as unprintable. it can take a dozen re-feeds for the printer to stop thinking the page is upside down. Still love the quick release of these but the printer misfeeds are wearing me down.You can't go wrong with Avery.  They are the masters of the office products genre.  And these labels are no exception.  They are perfect.If you are doing a mass mailing, and don't want to print out envelope by envelope, here is the solution.  If you so choose, they, of course, can also be used for individual mailing.They are 1" x 2-5/8" and very appropriate for No. 10 or smaller envelopes.  Tasteful but unobtrusive size-wise.  They peel off easily and adhere easily.  They also adhere securely.This is a great find for me as I have a mass mailing of my own to do and was wondering just how to handle posting the addressee without labels appearing to make the mailing look like it could be bulk mail.  These don't appear that way and I think they are perfect for their purpose.Avery makes the best in my estimation and these work perfectly with my software and printer.  I use a smaller version for return address labels.  This is probably my tenth pack of them.This worked smoothly and seamlessly in my laser printer as well even though they are intended for inkjet. I find that Avery and 3M (same company) always make the best labels.They seem to work fine so far. For those having problems: I would suggest you only use them on paper-based envelopes or material. OR, if used on a sticky surface perhaps cover the label with shipping tape. Just my suggestion.I use these labels to do marketing campaigns for my small landscaping business, and I was so impressed with how crisp and clean they look.The only stickers on the sheet are the labels themselves, so they are super easy to peel off, and you aren't left with any stupid little bits sticking to your fingers once you're nearly done using the sheet of labels. I really love that new design.The labels also went through my printer with no issue. I was worried that because they've eliminated that outer quarter inch of excess label and just left the labels themselves on the sheet, that the sheets might get stuck in my printer or not feed as well. To test how they fed, I loaded in a stack of labels instead of feeding them one at a time as I used to. I needn't have worried, my printer took up each sheet with no difficulty and no jamming and printed out beautiful address labels.I'm very happy with the quality here. They've really managed to eliminate everything I find annoying about printer labels. Everything about these is perfect.I've always been pleased with Avery products in the past and these labels are no exception.  The quality is good and the easy-peel feature is very convenient.These are great labels: cost effective, opaque, and they peel off their backing when you are ready to stick them on something rather than inside your printer.The free Avery templates (available online) make formatting a breeze.Highly recommended.These work great in my printer, and peel easily from the backing.  We use them to put important information on business cards for reminders.Avery brand labels are the best  ..... these are just like in the store, only cheaper. It is a good product that I use a lot ...... have never had any problems with the labels I've bought from Amazon.Just got a new printer - the old one had trouble pulling through labels etc to keep on the lines. This one does not, and so the labels themselves are great No complaints!Do you ever get tired of writing out all the information onto an envelope?  Me too, so I decided to get with the 20th century (I know its now the 21st century) and print out labels.  It was so easy, that I started labeling everything from which tools should be in what drawer of the toolbox to what items are missing from the shelves at work for re-order.  This is great.  Wish I had done this sooner.  As for the brand of labels themselves, they seem to be very high quality but time will tell.I've been using Avery labels, including this style, for many years.Avery caught on to the potential of what was then known as the "micro computer" market at the very beginning and has turned out an amazing variety of labels for a bewildering array of purposes.Labels are actually reasonably complex products in terms of the technologies they employ, such as the adhesives they employ.Well, how do you take something as seemingly simple as a 1 x 2-5/8 inch label and make it better? Why not just leave well enough alone and continue with the same style as they started off with so many years ago? Avery doesn't think that way, which is good for us.Avery redesigned the carrier sheet so peeling off the labels is simple as can be. It used to be that you had to bend the sheet to separate a label from the sheet and then slip a fingernail underneath it to peel it off. Now, Avery has eliminated the paper between the row of the labels and you just bend he carrier a bit and pull off the label. Simple, faster and less frustrating then it used to be.The labels are designed for ink jet printers and I had no trouble feeding them as single sheets.There was no spreading or blurring of colored inks.Avery has long offered design templates to make creating labels a lot easier. Way back when, printers and software were less sophisticated and you really had to know what you were doing to print labels without a lot of waste and hassle. Now just download the template, use it in a major word processing or other application that supports them and you're set to go.Avery still plays at the top of the label game and this particular style carries on that well deserved honor.JerryIt serves its purpose. Has tons of labels in the pack. The Easy Peel series is unbeatable, in my opinion.These are quality labels. Easy to print and mine did not smudge - when used with both a laser printer and also a deskjet printer.  They are the right size to use on either a legal or short envelope 1x 2 1/2 inches.Look on the Avery site for templates if your word processing application does not have this label size templated.the labels COULD be a little larger to be more readable on an envelope....hence the four stars.  However, these do the job and you get more per package.I love these labels and find that they have a million uses around the house beyond just addressing envelopes and packages.  I keep a database of people to whom we send Christmas cards.  It is kept in an address label template.  Each year, I check the list to add or remove individuals and then run off a set of labels.  Doing this instead of hand addressing dozens and dozens of envelopes saves a ton of time during the busy holiday season.  If I have white envelopes for the cards I can use these labels.  If the envelopes are another color, I use the clear labels.  Changing the font easily adds a more artistic and attractive touch.  I use the same process for party invitations for our annual Super Bowl party and for other events.The labels can be used one or two at a time to address small batches of mail.  The template called for on the package is super easy to set up in the computer with no figuring out margins, spacing, offset and separation.  The Easy Peel labels are fast off the page and onto the envelope with no picking and messing with removal.These labels can also be used as name tags for get togethers where all the guests do not know each other.And the labels can be used to mark items in storage.  They mark shoe boxes to identify the contents, doll collection storage, jewelry storage and lots of arts and crafts containers.A wonderful way to keep all your life easily organized and to do it quickly and easily.For the most part I've always liked Avery products.  These particular labels feed well through the printer. Inkjet printing comes out clean and smudge free.  They also stick very well. They are the perfect size for most envelopes.  I recommend them.First, about the labels themselves: they work very well with ink jet printers, as designed, and fed through reliably with my Canon inkjet. The ink never smudged, and the labels came out perfectly clear. They are easy to peal off, and yet never peeled off when they weren't supposed to, even when I sent sheets through the printer with many of the labels already taken out. So, these are great labels, and I can't come up with a single complaint.Second, about the software: I have a Mac, so I didn't try the desktop software. However, on their website they have literally thousands of templates that will work with Microsoft office, and even Apple Pages. Much of it is a bit cheezy, but they have some very plain templates, and you can always edit out the pictures. This makes the labels extremely easy to use, as the templates avoid trial-and-error on placement and margins.All in all, a very nice label solution. One word of caution, however, and this is no fault of Avery and will happen with ANY inkjet product: the ink in inkjets is water soluble. That means if you use these for mail, you really should put transparent packing tape over the label. Probably not worth bothering to do this if you're making return labels, but mail does occasional get wet (neither rain nor sleet nor snow...) and a single drop of water can bleed an address printed on an inkjet.Avery continues to be the premier label maker, as evidenced by these fine labels. There are cheaper labels than these Avery labels, but if you need extremely high quality, then these are great.And, I've had experience with cheap labels where they get stuck half-way in the printer, and then ruin the printer. So it's my experience that a little extra on the price for good labels can save the price of a whole new printer.I liked everything about these 30-per sheet, 1x2-5/8 inch labels.Pros:+These labels are identical top and bottom, so you can feed them either way+These labels won't stick/jam in the printer, even if you have some of them peeled off. I re-fed partial sheets, and they worked well.+Very white labels+Worked well with my inkjet printer+Don't smudge very much if you get them wet+They have the unused area of the labels already torn off, so you can get to the labels easier. I think that's what makes them "Easy Peel"Cons:-None that I could see, but I'll update it if I find anyI gave these five stars, because they're about as good as labels could be.  Of course, at the end of the day, they're still labels.  They are nice, crisp, and sticky, and worked well with my inkjet printer.  (I have aCanon MP530).  Avery's new improvement is their "Easy Peel" technology - there's no label paper in between the columns, so you can bend the paper underneath to get a grip on your finished labels.  I have never noticed problems lifting traditional labels, but if it's a pet peeve of yours, then "Easy Peel" is something to look forward to.Where Avery really impressed me was their software.  If you go to their website, they have four free options to generate labels, including mail merges, included graphics, font formatting, etc.:1) The old standard, Microsoft Word mail merges with templates.  This is pretty much the same as I remembered - the 5160 template works perfectly, and I was able to do a test merge using my holiday list.2) An all online solution, "Avery Design and Print Online."  This is the standout for me.  Cool, fully online, capable of using my data files, with clip art and good features.  I like this a lot.  (It was a little finicky with my address file, but with a little editing, I got things running nicely).3) The "Avery Wizard" is a downloadable wizard that runs inside office products.  It basically does a mail merge, but simplifies things.4) "Avery Design Pro" - I had trouble figuring out this program.  It looks good for cards or envelopes, but for labels this small, it seems like more power than I needed.Avery consistently pumps out quality products and the base things you can expect from their labels hold true here: no smudging, ease of setup,good adhesive.  The added feature (although not very new, but new to me) is the Easy Peel feature.  As the product copy says, "Columns can be separated to expose label edges for easier, faster peeling".  That about sums it up.  No more folding back and prying.  If you save a second per label peeling, that's a few minutes saved on a good sized Christmas card mailing!  Anything that makes things easier in a "commodity" product warrants a five-star rating in my book.The labels are easy to create using an ink-jet printer and easy to apply.  Highly recommended.I've experimented with a number of different brands of labels but I always come back to Avery as the best.  I love Avery labels because:1) they provide a ton of free label templates on their website that are useful for a variety of purposes2) they peel easily and stick great to paper envelopes3) they are incredibly easy to print with high accuracy.  The templates ensure that you get exactly what you expect every time you print.I'm very happy with these address labels.This product works as advertised. Avery has been in the label business a long time, and knows how to specialize. They make affordable labels. The most difficult part for me in using labels made for a printer is setting up the program that has the addresses on them. Word makes this a little easier. Once this is accomplished, the labels can be put in the printer, printer settings changed to accept them, and you have printed address labels. Much quicker than doing this by hand, and they look so much better!Very easy to use these labels with Microsoft Word. I had no problem and they printed out great the very first try.what can I say other than it is labels and they work as they should. great price and performance. buy nowI've run my own business for years and tried my fair share of printer labels.  I've tried many styles and brands and Avery brand labels continue to be my favorites.  Avery seems to have done everything right with their new Easy Peel labels.  The paper is just the right thickness - blocks out any print underneath without creating a raised edge that gets caught easily.  The glue doesn't lose adhesion over time.  The paper is bright white with a smooth finish and the edges are cut smooth and clean.  Perfect!Plus the new Easy Peel feature makes peeling off a label nearly effortless.  The page is creased under the edge of the label sticker.  Just bend the page and the edge of the label pops up for easy grabbing.  Ingenious design!Number two runner up is 3M brand.  Their paper has a slightly rougher face, but their glue is just as strong.  No Easy Peel technology with 3M labels however.I've learned to stay away from Staples brand labels and the other generic brands.  The glue is worthless and the paper is too thin to cover over any old print.So if you're looking for a great printer label and don't mind spending a little more for quality, Avery brand Easy Peel labels are the way to go.  I've tried 5 different Avery Easy Peel styles and all are top notch.If you're doing a lot of labeling, this product makes it a lot easier to get the labels started.  Not much more expensive than the originals, and I think it's worth the extra couple bucks for the convenience.  Printing comes out fine on the paper, as well.These have never jammed my printer, are easy to peal off, and are strong enough to adhere to an envelope without worries.The avery easy peel address labels are a good product. The easy peel thing make is easy to get off if it was hard for you before. It worked well in my cannon MX439 printer. I would buy this product again when I run out.Great labels.  I especially like the opaque nature of these white labels.  If you make a mistake, you can just put another label on top of the previous one.Sticks great.Avery labels are my favorite brand of labels.  The work great on my laser printer.  I use these to label my catalogs and other business supplies.These easy peel labels ARE easy!  I also like the free cute templates on the avery.com/templates website.  I chose a coffee grinder and also a bee motif.  They are adorable and easy to use too.  I didn't have any problems with bleeding, and the bee had several colors all over the label.They are great for Christmas cards or any other mass mailing, since the paper backing is perforated and you can tear it away so the labels hang off the end a little.  I think they are sticky enough for everyday mailing on regular envelopes, and I print them up ahead of time to have on hand for bills and cards and things.They are a great price and don't loose their stick, I think they are great!  Will definitely recommend them.I used my entire package of these up already and have purchased these in the past several times last year to create labels for my classroom library.  They align well, the ink doesn't smudge once it dries a bit, and they adhere well.  After spending hours designing classroom bin and book labels, I want labels that can stand up to 2nd graders.  And my 2nd graders love to read.  I only had one label come off (in a year) and it had to do with someone picking at it after it got wet and became smudged.  While these are a bit more than the store brand in those big box stores, I'd rather spend a bit more and have a product work.I can always depend on Avery to give me a quality product.  These little labels are what we use the most in our household.  They are handy for everything.  We use them with the free downloadable templates from their website so they are positioned accurately and look crisp and professional.  You can just print one or a whole sheet... and now the directions are right on the back of each sheet, very handy.  If you collect boxtops for education, they are cleary displayed in an area that can easily be cut out without disturbing the contents.No jamming, yet each individual label is easier to pick up without dislodging the outside border.  No problems.Highly recommended quality product.Avery is a brand well known for labels etc and I have no complaints on this item. Arrived in gr8 condition, needed something fast and got it here with this order. Quality labels for the price. Recommended.Our town's energy committee recently had a project for which we needed about 250 peel-off labels.  Our plan was to distribute 250 CFL (compact fluorescent) light bulbs free at our town's community day (sort of like a street fair) in order to encourage people to use the bulbs to reduce electricity use.  CFL light bulbs can save about 75 percent on electricity over incandescent bulbs.  For the 250 bulbs, we calculated that for 8000 hours of use and an electric cost of $0.10/KWh the total savings vs. 100 watt incandescent bulbs for all the bulbs would be about $15,000.  There would also be a saving of 94 tons of carbon dioxide emission.Avery Address Labelswere a good choice for adding a label indicating the savings for using the bulbs and our committee's name.  The question was how to get the information printed on the labels.  At the Avery web site, I found free software, DesignPro, which makes it possible to produce label designs for different label sizes.  I downloaded the software easily and got started on the designFor laser printer labels, there were fourteen pre-made templates for the different size labels.  I chose the template that matched my labels.  Using DesignPro was a little like using PowerPoint.  I was able to cut and paste a graphics image, add the appropriate text, and choose a font for the text.  A test run on my color laser printer produced a beautiful matrix of labels.  The only problem was to find out which side of the label stock had to be up.  I can never remember.  After an up/down test, I had my sheets of labels printed in no time.Our community day give-away was a big success.  Our free light bulbs lasted about four hours.  We had enough time to peel and apply the labels as we gave away the CFLs.  One surprise is that we had to have a sales pitch even for give-aways.  The other surprise was that many people had never seen CFLs before.  I am now a big fan of Avery labels, but I recommend getting the free software to make them work.I had a chance to try a pack of these (08160) for free and figured what the heck -- I'm always annoyed at having to fill in the return address.I was expecting to have to wrestle with MS Word or something to print the labels but actually you can just go to their website, which they list on the back of the label sheet [...].  Tell it what label sheet you have (8160 in this case) and it will help you create a design and fill in the information to print and then pop up a webpage and fire up a print job.  It was as easy as could be.  No download, no messing with Word or Adobe, just a website to visit.I did a test sheet on regular paper but it was right on the first try.I see another reviewer complained about the stickiness.  I put a couple labels on a sheet of paper, pressed them firmly and let them sit for a minute and tried peeling them off.  I had to pick at the edges to get it started but then it peeled off without much tearing of the paper underneath, so I have to agree that the glue could stand to be stronger.  Still, for regular letter mail I can't imagine them coming off.  For packages, which I imagine get more friction in the mail, I would probably not use these labels.These labels are the usual kind.  The service was fine.  No problem with delivery.  I rec'd exactly what I ordered but I personally like the clear ones better.These labels work great in an ink jet printer, but each label is very small (1 x 2+5/8 inches).  There are two issues.  First, getting your ink jet to align with the labels is hard because there is no flexibility.  A slight feed error and the printing overflows on the next label, and the whole set of 30 labels must be thrown out.  Second, even when you get these lined up perfectly, the label is very small.  You can get three lines only- squeezing four lines requires type that is too small, or lines that are too closely spaced.  I gave this 4 stars because the labels are well made and work as advertised.  I took one star off because the labels are too small, and I do not understand why they would suggest these are good for address labels-  they are simply too small for most applications, and simply too small to line up properly on a printer.  The templates are fine.  But my epson printer grabs them with a slight shift each time.In all other aspects, these are excellent ink jet labels.  I tried them out in my laser printer, and it worked, but not well.  So these must be used in an ink jet printer.Recommendation:  Get the next size up unless you really need the small size for some reason.Prints great with my Epson & they don't jam in the printer. Sticks well on both letter envelopes & padded envelopes.These are general use return address/locate labels. 1 inch by 2.625. I checked MS word and MS works and Avery provided the Avery template numbers, so they worked well with all my applications without the need for me to download the templates from the the Avery website. And, of course, Avery was the industry leader in labels from the beginning, so you can not loose buying these.So far I have not had any problems with these labels but I only use them on envelopes for invitations and thank you's. What I like about Avery products is that you can always find an exact template for their products for free on their website. These labels print well, no smudging, they feed through the printer without any problem and they seem to stick well. If you want a quality product, you always get that from Avery.Having just moved, I haven't had a chance to try printing these yet, but have used a sharpie to mark them for storage containers. Good labels so far.On occasion in the past, troubles have arisen as I attempt to run various labels thru the printers, mainly for mailing. These special labels just seem to flow right thru with a nice clean look, and no mix-ups anywhere in sight. So how can you beat that for labels?  Don't know if you can!I have had bad experiences with "generic" printable labels in the past...namely, with the sheet getting stuck in my printer.  So far, I have had no problems at all with these labels.  They go through the printer smoothly.  The labels are easy to peel off the sheet as well.If you go online to the Avery website, there is a free software download that allows you to customize the labels to your liking.These are so handy for mailing newsletters for our garden club. We use a Brother 640CW printer and the labelers work very well. Note these are for ink jet.The fact that they offer the software online to customize and print all of the print stock they sell keeps me coming back for more!I recently sent out a bunch of thank you cards and used these labels to do the addresses.  I have used Avery products for years for various types of labels. The first thing I noticed was the recycle-logo on the back of the package - the package itself is made out of recycled paper and both the labels and the package are recycle-able!  Love that fact!  Then I noticed the changes to the label sheets themselves.  Now, instead of covering the entire sheet with the sticky-back paper, the sheets now only have the label (not the excess label paper around the actual labels) so it is wasting less!I printed a custom designed address label (designed a graphic in Photoshop) by using the free Avery software (downloadable at Avery.com) and they printed very nicely!  Plus - BIG plus - is that the labels are very easy to peel off the sheet to use!  Much easier!Also, the Avery software is very easy to use - you can import your own images/photos/graphics or use some of their pre-made clip-art.  you can also import mailing lists from Microsoft or print directly from Microsoft, Photoshop, Illustrator or InDesign by downloading the template you need from their website!  SO EASY!  I love printing out my own custom designs so I love using these labels!I gave some of these to my daughter to use in her business mailings and she really likes them. She told me they were easy to peel once printed and she had no problems getting them through her printer. She didn't try sending them through the printer multiple times, so don't know how well that would've workedThese Avery Easy Peel Labels are another nice addition in a go-to line of Avery products.  I have used their products in the past, and I have always been happy with their mailing labels.  This product is no exception--it is a great product too.  Things to like:1.  Avery is now printing the directions on how to print your labels right on the back of each individual printer sheet, and I am so glad that they have done this.  No more looking for the directions on how to format the printer--they are right there on the sheet (they are in English and Spanish).  It also has an address to their web site and lists all the things you can design on their site.  It also has the customer support 800 number printed on the front and back of each sheet should you run in to a problem.  The Spanish version has telephone support numbers listed for Mexico, Venezuela, Brazil, and Chile.2.  A Pack of Freebies.  Included in the labels pack is a four pack of Avery Repositionable Note Tabs.  You can use them to mark textbooks and notebooks.  A nice little bonus that gives you a chance to try a new product before you buy it.3.  Two "Box Tops for Education" coupons on the outside of the package--easy to cut without ruining the integrity of the packaging.  We save box tops in our house for the kids' schools, so this was a nice little bonus for me.4.  The packaging these come is 100% recyclable.5.  The labels are easy to print, the ink dries quickly, and come off the sheet very easily, yet stick nicely to an envelope or folder.I am very happy with these labels and would buy them again.  Another great product from Avery.I like my old HP 6840 deskjet printer. It just works and works. But the paper path flips the paper over. This is usually BAD for peel off labels. So, I was happy to try the avery easy peel labels for inkjet printers.These labels print cleanly, peel easily, and stick well. They do everything the label says, and everything a label should. I'm full satisfied. Finally.I print all my own address labels, and have done so for my at-home business for years.  Lately I've been noticing that some labels I buy don't seem to work with the template given to use with them.  I use The Print Shop Deluxe software for making up my labels, and when I designed some using the template I was told to use, they printed totally off-center and not in the right place, wasting a bunch of printer ink on unusable labels.  This seemed to mostly happen with the new "easy peel" labels, which often had one product number but said on the package to use another product number template.  I got very frustrated by this.  I tried using an on-line Avery software, and had little better luck.  I'd pretty much almost decided no longer to print my own labels, but when given a chance to review this product, thought I'd give it another try.Well, so far so good.  I've just printed up about 15 sheets of labels, and all printed precisely correctly.  I have a fairly cheap HP inkjet printer, and it has printed them well.  These are smaller labels than I usually use, as I like to put a picture on one side of the address, and these are a little too small to do that and also have room for a legible address, but that's not the fault of the labels!  They are plenty big enough for an address that can be clearly read.  The smaller size also allows lots of labels to be made from the one pack.  So for now, my faith in Avery is restored!This is an excellent product for home or office use. I tried this out for our home office, my husband's business, and it was great.It is so easy to set up the label template in MS Word, and it worked with no problem. Or, as the package says, you can go to the Avery web site and down load their template; however, it took me several tries on their website because I kept getting an "unavailable" message. But once I got through, it was easy to locate the template with their search button.The nice little touch that makes this sheet of labels different from other products is that the space between the labels on the sheet is notched. You don't notice it at first, but the instructions say to "bend at the column until the edge of the label pops up", and sure enough, that is exactly what happens.This is a very time saving and convenient way to get labels off the sheet without tears. Also, as advertised, I ran several sheets and none of them ever got caught in my printer - another wonderful convenience!So, I highly recommend the Avery Easy Peel lables.Avery products are a must for our home office as well as for work. I love the Easy Peel labels particularly because it truly is easy to peel off. I run several bulk mailings for church and these are the quickest way to get our labels done. They come out of the inkjet printer perfectly and worked in our photo copier too. I use this is conjunction with the Avery label software with seamless results.I've always had good experience with Avery products.  They're the big name in labels, business cards, etc.  Using the big guy has its advantages, for one thing it's very handy because most programs like Microsoft Office and OpenOffice.org already have defaults for most sizes of their products.  I have OpenOffice.org and it found the size easily.  On the back of each sheet, there are instructions telling how to download the Avery Wizard for Microsoft Office.  It also talks about their templates available on their website, however I've never needed to use any; I just use the ones in the word processor.You'll pay a little more for them than the generics, obviously, but it's not much more and it's worth it.  With the cheap ones if you put the label down a little crooked, it sets immediately and you tear apart the envelope and label trying to move it.  These are a little more forgiving and can be adjusted somewhat.  That's a good feature for me.  It's also handy how easy the labels are to tear off.  They don't have the usual paper around the labels.  It's open so you can more easily pull them away from the sheet.The label paper is good quality.  They're for an ink jet printer and the ink didn't run at all when I used them.  The sheets went through the printer smoothly with no issues.  They correspond perfectly with the templates in the word processing programs I use, so printing out a sheet of labels is a simple and painless.I'm quite happy with these and would happily recommend them or Avery business cards (if you're doing cards on the cheap).Haven't used Avery labels for quite some time; however, since i recently became treasurer of our HOA, it's my duty to mail dues requests twice a year - labeling envelopes is never fun, but decided to try these labels... in the past, picking the label off the sheet was a wearisome, repetitive task... but now, with Avery's redesign of its label sheets, a quick two folds of the printed sheet of labels, and label edges pop up - making the job of peel-and-place a *lot* easier! Good job, Avery!I use these labels with "Poly Bubble" mailers to ship items. Twice in the last couple of months I've had items returned because the labels came off at some point during shipping. The mailers I'm using are brand new and have a smooth surface; there is no reason an address label shouldn't stick to them. It's possible these labels work better with paper-based envelopes and mailers, but I no longer trust these labels and am in the process of looking for an alternative.We use these labels for all of life's major milestones. They've been used for wedding invitation, wedding thank you's, thank yous, birth announcements, christening invitations, and more. I wouldn't use anything else. Great quality. We use them in an HP inkjet printer.These are a bit thicker than the generic labels I've been using for a while. They are indeed easier to peel making short(er) work of large labeling tasks. No problems with jamming, smudging or sticking. They work perfectly in my HP printer. No complaints.I've tried all the cheap brands and Avery is still the best when it comes to these labels. They print cleanly and smoothly without jamming in the printer. They also adhere solidly to the surface which is important. Even if it's a little more, I rather pay for this and have peace of mind knowing the labels aren't going to fall off somewhere. Good stuff.Although I have had the opportunity to use other brands through the Vine program, I am still very pleased with the price and performance of the Avery brand of labels.  I have never had an issue with these labels smudging or jamming in my laser printer.  I use these not only for address labels, but also for frequently used notes on packages (e.g. Fragile) and to label file folder boxes as well.  The templates to use create the data for the labels are included with Microsoft Word and make easy work out of getting them printed properly.There isn't much to write about a standardized product such as labels.  These are good quality, and they work well in our HP LJ2200D printer.They stick where you put them.Highly recommended.Avery is the standard for computer printed labels, and have been for years.  These laser labels print well, don't smear, and stick well to envelopes.Why did I give them a 4* review?  Because I think this new "Easy Peel" label is a solution looking for a problem.  I've labeled thousands of envelopes (I sell real estate and send out mailers on a regular basis), and I never had a problem with the old style label.These "Easy Peel" labels have a line where you fold the paper and the edge of the label sticks out making it easier to peel off.  When I tried this, the top labels stuck out fine, but the sheet didn't quite fold on the line so the bottom labels didn't stick out as well.  I'm not sure that taking the time to fold the sheet 3 times to peel off the labels actually saves any time.I haven't done a major mailer with these labels yet, but I think the regular Avery labels are just as good.As address labels these do everything you'd expect them to do - you can print names and addresses on your printer, peel them off easily, and stick securey to envelopes. If your wordprocessor doesn't have a template for them, one can be downloaded from [...].However I also used these labels for another purpose - organziing several closets. No longer do I have to remember which sheld the fitted king sized sheets are on and which is the fitted queen sheets - just print out what you need on these labels, stick them to the front of the shelves, and you're done. (Just use a nice large readable font). I reorganized the linen closet, hall closet, and basement closet using them and I couldn't be happier.These labels work perfectly.  Labels are such a time and effort saver, and they are so versatile; there are so many things you can do with them.  I can't imagine living in a world without labels.  These particular ones are for laser printers, but they can also be used just for writing on.  They are easy to peel.  They are address labels, but you can use them for a variety of different reasons.  These labels are really awesome.Convenient, practical, good quality, and they make life easier.  These labels can do so many things and you can use them for so many reasons - the list is endless.Highly recommended for office, home, school, workshop, playroom, etc. - the list is endless.and yes, they are easy to peel off, haven't caused a printer jam, print nicely and sticks well. i don't know what the difference is between the 5160 and 5260 because they seem to be the same size. from what i can tell, the only difference seems to be that the 5160 comes in a much larger pack (3000 labels) than the 5260 (750 labels). so if you're in need of many more labels than 750, i'd buy the 5160 instead of multiple packs of 5260. but for casual home users who don't want 3000 labels (that's 100 sheets of labels - it's a lot), the 5260 would be a better choice even though you spend more per label - buying in excess is more wasteful than paying for a smaller pack.Found myself using these handy little strips for labeling all kinds of things... you will too !Avery makes some really great products.  It's certainly a name you can trust.  These labels work great for my needs.  I also love the available downloads from the Avery website.  I've had nothing but a pleasant experience with this item and getting the job done.The price seems to be pretty reasonable.  I would also like to add that the price on Amazon is, I think, a little bit cheaper than what I have paid in the past at a couple of different office supply stores (not to mention any names).These are your world famous Avery 5160 style labels. It is so well known, apparently, that "5160" is a registered trademark...interesting.TESTINGMy first tests with with an HP OfficeJet Pro K5400 and HP DeskJet 5650. Yes, these are inkjet printers and this is supposed to be a pack of laser labels. Despite that fact, the labels performed very well.  Large text and small text are both clear and crisp with minimal ability to smear (not any more than any other paper).In my test with an HP LaserJet 4050, it went through the printer perfectly and the printed labels look terrific.FEATURESThe "Pop-up Edge" for fast peeling is useful. This is by no means unique, as 3M has the same thing in their labels, but it is useful for quickly pulling labels off. It works by having a perforation strip under the right edge of each label column, so you can fold the sheet and the edge of the label will stick out and be ready to pull off.ADHESIVENESSAs for the adhesiveness, it is a moderate stick -- you can carefully peel it off once you stick it on, but it will not go anywhere if stuck on paper.As you would expect from Avery, these are very high quality labels good for home or office that have stood the test of time.I tried this product and liked it, but tried to call Avery to gather more information on their products and was disappointed with the fact that they have outsourced all of what used to be US jobs to Manilla, Philippines!!! On their web site, Avery give the appearance that they are located in Brea, California, but in reality all of their consumer inquires, information on their products, software support, and general questions are all routed to the Philippines. I was not able to connect with anyone in the USA after more than 30 minutes on the phone with several different people in Manilla.In addition, all of their products are manufactured in either Mexico or China. I am hesitant to use or recommend Avery products since there are very few US jobs associated with any their products.**************************************************My initial review of the product was good prior to my call to the "Consumer Service Center" in Manilla:I downloaded the Avery Wizard 4.0 to help me make the labels. It took some time to download and install, but well worth the time. The wizard was easy to use. Once you down load the software there will be a new toolbar in Microsoft Word. You simply click the Avery button and it gives you a comprehensive list of all of the Avery products (listed by product number). After that is takes you through a few easy-to-understand wizard windows to enter the text and layouts your labels. Once completed, you have a MS-Word document that you can save on your computer and reprint if needed. I was able to make address labels with a small graphic quite quickly and easily.Even though these are listed for use on a Laser printer, I used them on my ink-jet printer and they turned out quite well. Even after roughing up the label by crunching it up, it stayed clear and legible. The "Easy Peel" backing allows you to reposition or remove the label although it does hold in place and will not easy fall off.These labels are nice.  They remove from the backing very easily as promised.  I gave he product 4 stars because there are 750 in a package, so for business that might be fine, but personal use 750 labels will last a lifetime.  Avery does make a quality product that prints up very nicely in most printers.  I would recommend this product.These work like a charm if you use the corresponding template.  M printer is hardly the latest model but still works so I really appreciate that the lables don't get stuck in the printer. Other good points: the ink does not smudge and they are easy to peel and stick.Side-by-side comparison:3M Address Labelsare just as good, and usually less expensive. Go for the better price.I've used Avery and 3M labels for years.The 3M have the same easy-peel layout, without the laughable salesmanship.The 3M package claims "Permanent Adhesive" and "Strong Stick." The Avery stick just as well, or almost as wellI find the 1" x 2-5/8" size is big enough if you use size 9 font (Arial). I get up to 38 characters per line x 5 lines.I like to print address labels and these are wonderful.  They peel off easily but don't jam up the printer.  I highly recommend them for home offices and for people who need to print labels at home.Another effective Avery office product that's relatively easy to use. Works fine with our home(Panasonic) and office(HP) laser printers (I didn't bother trying the labels with our ink-jet printers).  Avery provides FREE templates for Microsoft Word and also their own Design and Print Online.  It was easy to print out address labels for our clients.  Just make sure the printing is aligned properly with the labels.  The Pop-up Edge feature ensures effortles peeling of the labels.  There were no smudging.  Avery has kept it simple and useful.These are easy to use and I only had to use 2 sheets of plain paper to get them aligned. It works fine with my cannon printer but I prefer to put them in 1 at a time. I didn't have a problem with these but I one had a problem with the printer taking more than one sheet then it wanted to jam.I like the size they are big enough to clearly see the address but not too big to take up too much space.I several pages with return addresses and I will save some for addressing envelopes at Christmas time.These are simple to use. An easy download into Word and they printed great. The peel was easy and looked amazing on the envelopes!If you are accustomed to office store brand labels which are simply incised through the top layer of peel-and-stick paper, you are in for a pleasant surprise with these labels from Avery. The user only needs to bend the paper at each vertical row and the labels stick up on the ends for easy removal. These are also comparably priced to the office store brands in a similar quantity. So given the choice, buying these more convenient to use labels is a no brainer. At this writing, though, I could not find these in large quantities, so the office store brands can still beat these in price in large quantities. Nevertheless, I recommend these and feel the ease of use saves enough time to warrant additional expense for larger quantities.I have been using Avery 5260 address labels for years.  They are perfect for addressing envelopes, labeling files, and even captioning photos in albums.  Avery labels are easy to use, rarely smudge, and peel off easily. The package contains 25 sheets, 30 labels per sheet for a total of 750 labels.  Avery address labels are handy for home, school, or office use and work well with most printers.  Highly recommended.I got a laser printer and wanted to try out the laser version of these address labels. They are great! Print great and stick great. And they are easier to remove than they used to be. I use address labels for addresses (obviously), but also for all sort of things. Mainly labeling things. But you'll be surprised at how versatile these can be!Avery is a brand that has been doing laser labels for as long as I can remember and they put out a very nice product.  This particular size, the 5260 is the perfect size for address labels for envelopes.  Three columns, ten long means you get 30 labels to a sheet.Easy peel off, easy printing with no jams.  The perfect label.The nice thing about Avery is that it works seamlessly with Microsoft Office.  In word they have templates for all the Avery laser labels and you just have to select which one you are using and the blank template just pops up.  Sometimes with generic brands, this is not the case and you have to manually set your parameters which while doable for a regular MS Word user could prove to be quite an obstacle for the casual user.I highly recommend these labels to anyone.  They will not give you trouble.I have been using Avery mailing labels for quite a while. I was successfully printing addresses on Avery 8160 labels in both ink jet and laser printers, so I was puzzled when I found the Avery 5260 labels designed specifically for laser printers. The only difference I detected is the strip of label paper along the left edge of the page of labels. I suppose this helps prevent jamming in laser printers, but I never experienced jamming with the 8160 nor 5260 labels.I have switched to laser printing exclusively because the cost per page is so much lower with the lasers printers and the ink never smudges once it leaves the fuser.The bottom line on this is, I will probably continue buying the Avery 5260 labels.. .for just about anything. I use these 1) to label my chargers and wires that seem to multiply on their own in the drawer. 2) Put reminders on. . .just about anything. 3) Little notes for my hubby that won't get lost or blow away. 4)Of course, for files, papers, notes. Easy to remove from the backing. I don't do mail merge, but that's what their made for. Be creative.Overall these are very good labels and my complaint doesn't really count since they directions say not to run the sheet of labels through the printer more then once, but I do.  With the easy peel labels the sheet tends to get stuck a little more in the printer then before, but it's not a ton.  And I reuse sheets because really, I'm not wasting a whole sheet for 2 or 3 addresses!  Besides that I've never had a problem with these labels smudging or not sticking, I've always been pleased with Avery labels.Labels are bright and peel easily.  They adhere well to my crushed velvet and make a great presentation.  Easy to use.I've been using Avery's 5267 product to make return address labels for some time now, but despite the increasing quaintness of postal mail, I still have a few people and companies that I mail things to every so often, so tried out Avery's 5260 address labels for laser printers to print up some address labels.  They just work.If you haven't used this type of product, it's a breeze if you have almost any working version of Microsoft Word, because Word has built-in templates for Avery's various labels.  Just open or create a document, type in the address you want on the label, select Mailings/Labels (in Word 2007 - varies by version), tell it that you want to use Avery 5260 labels, and Word knows how to lay out the page and to replicate the text 30 times to fill out a page of identical labels.  Or you can give Word a list of addresses from a mailing list and it will lay them out to fit on the Avery product.This appears to be a new generation of Avery's line of labels, with "pop-up edges" to make it easier to peel each label from the page, as compared to older versions which required you to bend the page or pry out each label with your fingernails.  Amazing how it's possible to improve even a seemingly mundane product.Anyway, these just work and I don't even think about them when creating or using them - which to me is the definition of usefulness and quality.No smudging, no pulling off the sheet when printing, and they come off easily when desired.  No complaints on these labels.I purchased these since some other brands I had purchased were not sticking to the envelopes well, and the laser ink on them actually was not sticking well at all.  This brand, so far, is working OK. I haven't done a super critical test yet.  But the printer is a high grade Brother semi-commercial, so I am sure the fusing is not the fault of the printer itself.I've been using the Avery products for years and this is just as good as most of their other products.  The thing to remember is to use the proper template and to run a trial through your printer first.  Sometimes your printer runs the pages through crooked and you don't want to waste the stickers if they are going to come out crooked.Great labels. Easy to use. Didn't come off in my laser printer. Very happy with productI've used lots and lots of labels over the years and believe the Avery Easy Peel Address Labels a great value for the money. Of course, you can also use them with inkjet printers, etc. Check it out.I don't know how Avery continues to improve on products that seem to work so well, but they manage to find ways to tweak their labels to make them even easier to use.These labels work as promised - no jamming in my printer, the print is legible and clean, and the labels peel off like magic. I've used Avery products for years and I'm never disappointed. These labels are no exception. They zip out of my printer in a jiffy, and the labels are great to use on all sorts of packaging. I ship a lot of things in the craft bubble mailers, and these labels stick like a charm.These meet my basic requirements extremely well:- They come off the printer cleanly, without jamming.- They don't smudge.- Peeling them off the backing is simple and clean.- And they adhere nicely to the envelope.They work great!This is yet another great label product by Avery.  Of course it works with Avery's DesignPro template software.  I used these in a HP LaserJet printer and had no issues with smudging--all the print was clear.  The only thing I did not like was the pop-up edge for fast peeling.  It works great if you print a full sheet of labels each time, but occasionally I only need to print a few labels and when the sheet goes through the printer a few times it can start to separate easily.  Not a big deal, just something to be aware of if you only print a few labels at a time.  I would recommend these labels and I would buy them again!Yes, these labels are just as they are described, but even better than I expected.From past experience with printing labels, I figured I'd have to spoil a few sheets to "get the system zeroed-in."I was wrong.  I clicked on my label options, selected the appropriate Avery label number, and voila! printed my first sheet of labels--which were perfect.As they advertise, the labels are also extremely easy to peel, so I'm very pleased and will reorder these labels again and again.Make note that this product is for laser printers!  Great product for office or at home use.  If you have a mass mailing to do, you will find Avery templates and labels extremely useful.  These products come with Easy Peel technology to make sticking the labels on envelopes even easier.  Anytime you have to print labels, look to these Avery labels.  A good value for your money.  You can address 750 envelopes with just one package.  Do you know how much time mail merge, a printer, and some avery labels will save you.  You won't be disappointed!So far so good... I print a few labels at at time on a page so I may often put the same sheet back in my printer several times.  Not having the white column separation paper in between the columns helps eliminate the chance of jamming. Removing a label from the page is easy and trouble free.  For my type of use it seems a good choice.  Thumbs up!Avery has done it again!  Been using their product for years and I think these are a good improvement over prior functionality.I did use the template and verified that the printing surfaces were clean and ready to go prior to use.  In this way, the labels printed smoothly and easily.  There was not smudging.  The labels did not get stuck in the printer.As the sheet includes just labels (no margins), they peeled off easily and could be subsequently appliedquickly and neatly to the envelopes.  The finished look was neat and very professional and ready for mailing.Overall,  these are terrific  address labels for any user.I use labels on a regular basis, be it in the office or at home.  My number one brand of choice is always Avery.  Now Avery has enhanced the labels by making them smudge proof and easy to peel.  When ever I have a big job and have to peel over 100 labels...you better believe I want a label that can peel easily and quickly and this product delivers just what I want.  Some may think a label is just a label, but not so.  If you want the best of the best, buy Avery.If you have a home business or non-profit, these labels are helpful.  And they don't clog the printer.  And they peel off easily.  I have found uses for labels I didn't know about--the bins in the basement of old toys, LPs, pictures of Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert before they were funny.  Labels are a wonderful way to save time and trouble.  And these labels really are that.Compared with the same size Avery labels of different spec, you pay more than twice for this easy-peel feature per label.Avery Easy Peel White Mailing Labels for Laser Printers, 1 x 2-5/8 Inches, Box of 3000 Labels (5160). The easy-peel feature is simply a strip-away of remaining pieces on the paper. It then offers you " Pop-up Edge for fast peeling". I don't think it is worth the extra charge at all. Go get the basic one. You will be very happy with it.I do catalog mailings about once a month at work, we're a small company so I do the job from start to finish, stuffing and sealing envelopes, printing labels, attaching labels and running postage.The two things that take the longest in this process are stuffing the envelopes and peeling the labels to stick on the envelopes. This product doesn't solve both of these, but it sure takes care of one of them! These labels worked flawlessly in our printer, then just bend the backing and the edges of each label are there and ready to be peeled.Cut my labeling time nearly in half!I was a bit concerned that "easy peel" would mean "not sticky", but the labels adhered nicely to the envelopes, with no corner lifting at all.Great product!i ordered these labels because of the features promised: the Pop-up Edge(tm) for fast peeling and jam-free and smudge-free labels every time. i like how they perform-- they do indeed pop up easily when you bend the paper they are stuck to, and they print on very nicely. i also use them for writing by hand as multipurpose labels for photos, folders, books and binders to organize my files.These are good, standard solid labels from Avery - template suggestions are always on the package (so helpful) and I've used both the 3M version, Avery version, and branded store versions (like Office Depot) - they all work well as address labels - if you are wondering how to choose, I'd make your decision based on price, and features such as the Easy Peel (which makes using a LOT of these go much faster - think Christmas card mailings, wedding/shower invitations, etc)...as well as other features like (is it for a LASER or INKJET) printer?  Is it the right adhesive (does it stick well enough to the type of envelopes or packages you are using)...I would recommend this product from Avery - price and a few other features will help you make a quick decision between this & other brands, but Avery has been making good labels for a long time, so I would choose Avery where I could - I like their continuous improvement process!I rarely download templates for labels. I use the built-in mail merge in Word and it already supports pretty much every label made - including this one (5260.)I've been using Avery labels for over a decade, and this latest generation is a marked improvement. The biggest pain with previous labels was removing the label from the rest of the sheet - you know, the remainder after the labels were removed. These labels don't have that "remainder" - just the labels. It makes peeling off the labels easier, cleaner and faster.They fed fine on my laser printer and inkjet.People that complain about smudging on the 1st page need to clean the printer more often with a cleaning sheet, or pre-feed heavier stock. Labels are pretty thick!  Little fuzzies, pet hair (yes, I have found pet heir in my inkjet print head) and the like may not cause problems with normal paper. But put in card stock, photo paper or labels - you can have a mess.  That's why I'll always print a small color block on a piece of card stock BEFORE using labels, or use card stock as the first print as a test.  It's a lot cheaper than wasting a sheet of labels!Feeding: I always print test pages.  For example my laser printer has three drawers and a manual bypass. One drawer requires the labels be down.  Two drawers need them facing up. Manual bypass facing down, and tail-end in first.  Envelopes are even more confusing. With paper this is not a concern, with labels it always is.Here's a tip. Take a piece of paper. Use a pen and write TOP on the paper. Flip it over, write BOTTOM. Then draw an arrow on one edge- the edge that goes in the printer first.  Print a sheet of "labels" on this paper. Examine it. Scratch your head.  The results are often confusing - but will save you a ton of headaches.There's enough separation between labels to avoid printer run over. You won't go wrong with this high quality Avery product.These print very well, didn't jam my printer.  Just bend the sheet a little and the edge of the label pops up for easy removal from the sheet.  Sticks very well, doesn't seem like it would have a problem coming off, in the mail.This is a VINE review.As with other Avery products I've purchased, these laser labels are worth every penny.  The paper is solid, the labels peel easily, the sheets don't clog my printer, and they work perfectly for making address (or other kinds of) labels.  On top of this, they have free templates on their website, which are quick and easy to use.I'm quite sure I'll never purchase any other brand.  I highly recommend these labels.The Avery Easy Peel Address Labels are pretty good labels for the printers. The templates site was not too user friendly. I would suggest searching for the template 5160 instead of trying to look through it to find the correct one. I got the template in a word document format and it was pretty easy to type out.Just a hint, it takes two tabs to get over to the next label to start typing.The confusing part comes from the instructions on the labels. It shows as feed paper only one side. If you have a priner that has the tray on the bottom for loading, I would suggest you turn the sheet around so it prints properly. I accidentally put it the way it told me to and instead, it printed the labels on the back. Furthermore, I used these with a inkjet printer and it worked great as well.So these labels are as described, easy to peel and fairly easy to use. Just make sure to turn the sheet so the back faces you when loading if your printer is a front-load one.These labels are great - good quality, the ink doesn't run on them, and they peel off easily from the backing.They are a nice, bright white and are suitable for professional use.I'd like to review this item, but since ordering it over a month ago, it still hasn't come.If you have a mailing list in the hundreds, anything that shaves a little bit of time on the boring and repetitive parts of the project is very welcome. This new "easy peel" design couldn't be easier to use. You just bend the column every so slightly and you get an easy to grab edge that allows you to peel off each label without having to grab a corner by nudging with your fingernail, over and over again--even after going through the heat of a laser printer. I have found them to feed through smoothly (only one sheet at a time), not get jammed, not have one of the label corners accidentally adhere to the roller or feed dogs of the printer (yes, this has happened to me and it's a nightmare I'm glad to be able to put behind me). They work like a charm.NOTE TO AVERY:As much as I have loved these labels, I STILL have a slight objection. It has nothing to do with either quality, functionality, or design. It has to do with size. These one-inch high labels easily accommodate a three-line address. A four-line address fits. However, if you want to take full advantage of your word processor's capabilities and add a zip bar code line (which really DOES work in getting your mail delivered faster), you can fit it in on the three-line address, but it gets cut off on the four-line address.If you have a longer address structure, you're absolutely doomed. For example: I have several unmarried couples on my list. They each require a line. (Mr. John Smith, Ms. Mary Jones). I also mail some company executives, and this becomes a nightmare:Mr. John Smith, PresidentThe ACME Company1234 Main Street, Suite 5City, State, Zip//////bar code////////.This address does not fit on a 1" label.This makes creating a large mailing a real problem. I print the whole list (800+) in this label, then discard the ones that didn't fit and re-do them manually on label #05163, which are the next size up but, at 2" x 4" they are really to BIG. (#5962 which is 1 1/3" high doesn't provide that much of an improvement and it's still 4" wide!)Please, Avery, make a 1.5" x 3" label to accommodate the longest names and titles and the longest addresses and not look horrible on the envelope--and make them Easy Peel, just like this one.I like to use my laser printer to print labels for Christmas cards each year.  It is so much easier to load a sheet of labels and print a bunch of address labels rather than hand-write the address on each envelope.  I have used other laser printer labels for this purpose in the past, but they were an off-brand and somewhat difficult to configure with Microsoft Word.  These Avery labels are easy to use.  [...]. has free software available that makes printing on their labels quick and easy.  These particular labels use their 5160 template even though the box says 5260 on it.  You can print 30 labels per sheet.  As advertised, each is easy to remove.If you are looking for white labels for use on a laser printer, these are perfect for addressing envelopes.  They are sized small enough that they could be used for labeling other things such as small storage boxes, CD boxes, etc. although I'm sure their major use is intended for envelopes.  They are cumbersome to use if you only want to generate a few labels at a time, but if you need them in large quantity, this is the way to go.What can I say. They are very good labels. Peel off easy. Stick well. Don't smear when printed on. Doesn't jam up my printer. Can't think of anything else they would be need to do so 5 stars from me!These 1" x 2 5/8" labels have many uses. I've been using them for quite a while, and they've always performed perfectly. They stick well and they don't smudge.Also, although Avery says that each sheet should only go through a printer once, who works like that? I've done sheets printing one label at a time, with no problems at all. If you do that, I'd recommend starting with the bottom row of labels and working your way up. Of course, your laser printers might be different from mine, so your mileage might vary.The labels now have a "Pop-up Edge" for easy peeling, but I haven't used it, since I usually print one label at a time. The pop-up edge facilitates peeling of an entire column of labels at once. However, I've never had the slightest bit of trouble peeling labels off individually.They are excellent labels, and Avery offers software and/or templates to make it easy to print on them.These are terrific "every day" labels. I've tried them on both my laser and inkjet printers and have had no issues with smudging or jamming.The labels are thick enough that they don't appear see through.  They hold ink well.  The adhesive is very strong-no worries that the labels will peel off in the mail.I highly recommend these for you everyday no frills address labels.like the clear mailing labels a lot...usually more expensive than the white ones but look much nicer on oft colored envelopes...got these on a offer of buying 3 getting 1 free...Use these all the time.  Love them.  Great value when bought on Amazon.  Can be a tish hard to pull off, but if you bend the backing paper, they come off like a charm.These worked great for us. We pasted them on light parchment envelops and they disappeared. The ink was nice and crisp coming out of the printer. They were ok to remove from the sheet and adhere. Nice product.I love Avery labels, and always find a good deal on Amazon.  The work great on my laser printer.  I use them to label my catalogs and other business supplies, they work great.Came as described. The template is easy to use for mailing labels. They are a little small, so maybe get the next biggest size if you are looking for something more significant than a return address label.on envelopes, peels easily. If there is a problem, it is that it's very difficult to center things because if you're typing, it's hard to see where the individual labels are.They work well in my Canon multifunction printer scanner.  If it didn't work I wouldn't order the4 same thing again.  Only complaint is that the one edge seems to pull away from the backing paper before I'm ready for it.These labels are ideal for my printer and easy to peel off.  I would recommend them to anyone in the market for these types of labels.I like the size and quality of these note cards.  Made up invitations to a 70th birthday party for a friend and everyone thought they were professionally made.  Highly recommend.We bought these to use for Christmas cards. They are very nice, so much better than the quad fold cards. We were very impressed with them. Nice to have the envelopes that fit them too. I will buy them again.We use these in our business to send thank you notes to our customers with our own custom design on our color ink jet printer.  I always get them in a couple of days and really like the quality.I use these Note Card sheets for printing all my greeting cards.  For Christmas cards, thank you cards, get well cards, etc... I subscribe to a greeting card membership that allows me to make my own cards... to edit the verses, and to even modify the designs. I use these ALL THE TIME for all my cards. They are great. I have both size sheets to make the 4" x 5" cards and to make the larger cards of 5" x 8". Amazon supplies me with the material, and I make the cards.. it is FUN and I even get to add my name to the cards too. Avery is the best product for making cards.  Their paper is QUALITY and Avery makes ALL types of paper to print your cards on...Thank you Avery and thank you Amazon.I use these to print out my art work.  They are sturdy and I print on both sides.  I only wish that they came with a glossy side.  I'm sure there would be a demand for them.I use these in my home based small business. They are a fine product and I have no complaints about them. They are both professional looking and inexpensive... these are a basic, easy to use product.These are very good quality cards that can be printed for any purpose - Thank You, Invitation, X-mas cards etc. etc. Although the box says that they are for inkjet printers, I have used them in Dell, Brother & Samsung laser printers without any problem.But I did need to download the template from the Microsoft Office web site. The template also works for iWork & Pages in Mac - just open the template from the File menu in Pages. Then I found out that Avery has software providing templates for all its products at its web site. The software is DesignPro for Mac and Wizard for Microsoft Office on Windows and is available for free download at Avery web site. As of July each card and envelope comes to about 28 cents a card. Not bad.Bottom line - good product, saves from running to store each time you need a different kind of card and then you can also customize the card.Can't beat this price for 700 labels.  Works perfectly in my Dymo LabelWriter 400.  I have not experienced any of the issues reported by other users such as labels not printing due to no black markings on the reverse side of the label.  Nor have I had any issues with them not being sticky enough.  It will take a while for me to go through these.  I don't print a lot of labels.  But I will definently purchase again.Great labels for a great little machine.  I prefer the DYMO Brand of labels as opposed to the off brand name.  What more can one say!I use these all the time. Solid product that works as advertised. No jams no problems just solid, trouble free, everyday performance for label printing. I use them for address labels and for labels for file folders and other items for which I want a label..I use these in my Dymo LabelWriter 400 Turbo and they do the trick nicely. Easy to load and they print out crisp and clear text.We have a Dymo label printer. The label quality is perfect. We constantly run labels for Fed-Ex & USPS. The labels stick & ink doesn't smudge.Perfect addition to any dymo label maker...makes those sheets of address labels seem like a thing of the past!Perfect for my Dymo Label Writer 450.  Good quality.  Just what I wanted at a good price.  I couldn't find these locally.These Dymo are the best product to use in a Dymo labelwriter. I've used other cheaper brands and they are not as white and look cheap.  Go with true Dymo.These are awesome, however I'm going to look for cheaper labels, as I found ones for the 4XL printer that were the same quaity but 20% cheaper.This is a great product and is what I wanted. Just sucks I have to buy my own supplies for work.Check the size before buyingDYMO brand labels are more expensive than generic labels. A lot more expensive sometimes. However, I burned through 2 DYMO label printers with inferior generic brand labels. They got the machine jammed up and caused the entire machine to burn out and fail. Generic labels caused me a big headache and lost money and time. I still like my DYMO printer, but I learned my lesson the hard way. Spend the extra money on DYMO brand labels. Yes, they are probably charging a little too much, but it is what is. The labels are high quality and won't ruin your printer.While I love DYMO's printing of labels, I really despise their white labels.  A little bit of sun and heat and the thermal paper blacks out.Now, their clear labels are a whole other story...I love them!!  These allow a more professional look on envelopes, packages, and return mailer cards.Buy the clear labels - you will fall in love with how quick and easy they are to use.The machine has been in service for a long time and has performed flawlesslywith the use of Dymo original labels. Highly recommended.I've bought a lot of labels over the years, and I find that the original Dymo brand labels are always the nicest/brightest/whitest.  If you want nice bright/white labels, this is the best option in my opinion.I have used my Dymo label printer for a number of years, and am very pleased with it.  The labels work well and the output is excellent.....what more can I say??There really isn't much to say:  assuming you have decent label printing software, these labels label.  After a couple of months they seem to stick in place in contrast with other products I've used.Avery File Folder Labels are fast and easy to use. The paper is nice quality and they are easy to peel off. It works well on my ink jet printer and states it works with laser printers too. The labels are on acid free paper. I like that the labels are not side by side connected together like some labels I have used in the past but the labels have spaces between them (side by side) so they come off easy. The labels are close together on top and bottom but they don't stick together. Has anyone used labels like I had where the labels hang together or stick to the paper when peeled off? Ugh, I hate that. This one will not do that.I also like that it came with four free samples of Avery Note Tabs that was a pleasant bonus. Another great feature Avery has is free templates online for Microsoft Word and an Avery Design and Print. Going online, I found 44 templates listed for the file folder labels but about a handful of templates that will work with these specific file labels. They are basic but get the job done and look good printed out. Another freebie is the Avery Wizard for Microsoft Word for more creating. I use Wordperfect X5 and the templates work fine in it. I have yet to explore the other software listed but I just thought it was a great added bonus for using their templates. I will buy from Avery because they not only give quality labels, but go the extra distance and give more to boot.I tried this product and liked it very much, but tried to call Avery to gather more information and was disappointed with the fact that they have outsourced all of what used to be US jobs!!! If you call Avery's Consumer Service Center (1-800-462-8379 number listed on their web site as Brea, California) you will be given several choices of support all of which route you to their customer, product, and software staff in Manilla, Philippines.I wanted to get more information on where their products are manufactured. The operator I spoke with and her supervisor both assured me that all Avery products are made in the U.S.A. in Brea, California, but some of the raw materials may be from other countries. They were unable to route me to anyone in Brea to confirm this information. After examining the packaging I have I found a sticker that said "Made in Mexico." Other Avery products I have say either Mexico or China. None say U.S.A.I am very hesitant to use or recommend Avery products since there are very few US jobs associated with their products.**************************************************My initial review of the product was good prior to my call to the "Consumer Service Center" in Manilla:I have used sharpie pens on all my well-used file folders and decided to try these file folder labels by Avery. I was surprised how well they blocked out the old hand-written tabs with clean new labels. The TrueBlock Technology is simply a silver backing on the sticky side of the label.As for the templates, I downloaded the Avery 8366 template for MS-Word on Avery's website, but was disappointed that I could not get the text to center on the label when I increased the text to a legible size. So, I downloaded the Avery Wizard 4.0. It took some time to download and install, but well worth the time. The wizard was easier to use than the template. It comes with a few colorful graphics to make your labels interesting. I was able to use a big text size and center the text vertically and horizontally.Once I had my labels printed out, it was easy to peel and place the labels right in the file drawers, and I had a whole file drawer of easy-to-read folder tabs.A couple side notes. 1) Avery required that you give them your name and email for downloading a simple template which I didn't like. In addition during the Avery Wizard 4.0 install there is a box automatically checked to also install the Avery "Ask" toolbar and make it your default search engine. You can easily uncheck it, but rather tricky of Avery to set as the default to install additional software on your computer. 2) If you try and remove the label on your file folders, they do not easily release and you'll peel off some of your file folder with the label.Again, this may be a useful product, but very disappointing that Avery continues to outsource all their customer support and manufacturing!I've long been a fan of Avery products. Every time I buy an off-brand just to save a few cents, I always end up with paper jams or unusable smudged, smeared, or incorrectly placed labels. Avery products are always well-made and supported by every device that I use in my office. The Avery File Folder Labels are no exception.Speaking of software and formats, even if the program you have doesn't support Avery (I can't imagine which one that would be...) you can go to their website and download templates or even use their website to print! (This one is great because our office includes not only PC's but also several Linux machines).Lastly, I was happily surprised to see the inclusion of 2 "Box Tops". My children's school does an excellent job of collecting these and turning them in. It is nice to finally see these great incentives on products other than snack food.When is a label not just another label? When it's an Avery label! :)Since I usually print only one label at a time, I'm pleased a sheet will go through the printer many times correctly. I've used various software programs for printing these labels and they always come out looking great, plus a single sheet doesn't seem to be affected by the heat from the laser printer and even after many trips through, the labels still release cleanly, then stick well to the intended surface.  Even better, they can be removed cleanly when no longer needed.I use them for file folders as intended, but also for jars of stored goods in the kitchen.  These may be multiple jars of the same thing, e.g. jelly, or one jar of a newly ground spice.  I've given up thinking I'll remember what's in all those little spice jars.  There's plenty of room on these labels for the name of the contents and the date.I don't always use the printer.  I keep a sheet of the labels in the kitchen for quick labeling and just write on them with a pen or marker.  When I reuse the jar, the labels peel off in one piece and don't leave an annoying residue.My latest labor saver is to write the name of a device on one end of the label and fold it in half over the cable that device uses so there's no more guessing which cable goes to the scanner and which to the camera, etc. etc.  That worked so well, I labeled all my stored chargers so I now know which is which and don't have to try multiple plugs to get a fit.  Some things don't need charging often enough for me to remember which of the dozen little corded black boxes is the right one. I've seen tags you can buy for this purpose, but why spend the money when these labels work so well. In addition, if the cord is much longer than it needs to be I include several loops when I fold the label over it, effectively shortening it to a more manageable length.Now I'm beginning to label various items in my home discretely on the bottom or back to aid my kids when they inherit it all.  My daughter suggested it since she feared she wouldn't remember the details and dates of Great Uncle Sam's baby cup and like items.  Because the labels stick well, but release cleanly they seemed a good choice for this labeling.  If they are too big, I cut them in half.  With the printer you can get a lot of info on the label.I'm really pleased with this size and the quality and will re-buy.  Highly recommended for multiple uses.These file labels are part of a growing list of innovative office products being introduced by Avery and they are really worth the extra cost.The labels are acid free and utilize "TrueBlock Technology" that allows you to place a label over an existing one on a file folder and there is no bleed through...the label absolutely covers everything under it. Like most other reviewers I tend to try to use and reuse file folders and have at one time or another resorted to writing over labels with magic markers or sharpies or sticking labels over others to the extent that the folder looks, well less than professional.While I do not use the labels in my printer these come with free software online and templates that are easy to use.An added bonus is the generous Box Tops for Education coupons on each package. Since we have teachers in the family and grandchildren in school we are aware of the amount of money your school can earn by saving these coupons. It is not the primary reason I like these labels but is a tipping point when considering buying something, all things being equal.These labels are amazing in that they actually do what the manafacturer says they will do...completely cover up old labels and writing and allows the reuse of file folders.Highly recommended.I recently went through my filing cabinet and purged all of the old crap that was cluttering the drawers.  The problem is that I now had a stack of very usable folders that were "tattooed" by the old labels.  You can't tear the old labels off without damaging the tab and if you put new labels over them the writing on the old label shows through.These new Avery File Folder Labels are absolutely perfect for this situation: you can place them over old labels and they completely block out the writing on the old labels.  Problem solved!!Nice and heavy-duty, these are excellent labels.PS - It always makes my day to know that people find these reviews helpful. If you'd also like to ask a question or leave a comment I usually respond the same day, so if you have a question or comment (even if it's just to say, Hi!") feel free to post it below.Thanks,ClaireI like to print labels for my file folders so they are easier to read.  These labels go through the printer well and attach to file folders securely.  They are great!I'm starting my own business and these are working out perfect for setting files up for my clients.  Avery does a good job on all of their products.The folder labels are fine, but only time will tell how well they stick. I've used other kinds of Avery labels in the past and they tend to come unstuck after about 3-5 years. I bought those labels 15 years ago so hopefully they've fixed that. The problem with the software is that the lettering can look fine in Avery Wizard (when using WORD), but when you print or go to print preview, you may find that part of the lettering is actually off-label, particularly if you like to mess with different font types and sizes. So you have to go back and forth through trial and error until you get it right. Maybe by exploring more I'll find a better solution, but you'd think the text you see in the wizard's label box would appear the same when you print it out.To me, Avery is like the standard when it comes to printing labels.  The reason I say this is not only because of their high quality labels and products, but because when you buy it, you're pretty much guaranteed to find a template already in your office productivity software (e.g. MS Word/Excel).  Avery now has the added feature of being able to design the labels directly from their website and print (Go to their website, and then click on "Design & Print."  Avery is truly going the extra mile to make the process of printing labels as simple as possible.I've been using Avery labels for years, and they continue to improve upon their already excelent products.  This product in particular adds a special feature that they call 'Trueblock Technology'. For most people, this would seem like trivial.  A label is a label, whats the point?  For those of you that want to re-use old folders, and completely mask the previous label/marking, this label does the trick.  After printing out a sheet of labels, I placed them over folders with permanent markers markings, old printed labels, pens, and more.  On regular labels, you may be able to see faint outlines of what was written before.  With these labels, I was unable to detect any previous marking.  Works as advertised!There are 25 sheets of labels, each with 30 labels, for a total of 750 labels.  Whether you print or write directly on these file folder labels, what amounts to less than 3 cents per label, you can't go wrong with this.  Unlike some of their other labels, this particular one worked well with my Epson Photosmart printer as well as my ancient HP LaserJet 8150 (If your printer has the option to, be sure to specify that you are printing on a label versus a regular sheet of paper).Needless to say, I highly recommend this product.One of my summer projects was to file, re-file, and re-organize existing files. Not the most pleasant task in the world. One of the things I wanted to avoid this time around was my messy hand written tab titles for the hanging folders.Voila!These Avery computer generated tab title thing-a-me-bobs are exactly what was needed! Download the template, type the titles, print out and attach- couldn't be easier.I love it when simple products perform their designated task well and make my life just a little bit easier.These are easy to use, either with a computer template -- even available for Macs -- or to write on by hand.  They do cover all that's underneath, remove easily from the master sheet. I'll probably buy themwhen the sample set is used up.  I find most Avery products a good value and well made.I am giving this product 5 stars because the feeding instructions (for printing) were very clear, the template was easy to find in Word, and the print quality was good.What else could I want?I used these to update my business cards with twitter information, and they worked great.One of the things mentioned on the package of these file folder labels is that they have "TrueBlock Technology".  Well I couldn't wait to find out if that was true.  I have been making file folders for my home office files by reusing old folders from our business.  I have usually used a felt tip pen to write the name on the folder.  That is not a very attractive way to set up a system, but I tried some old file folder labels and the previously printed title just bled right through.  I had a ready made experiment for these new labels and I'm very glad to say that they did truly block the writing underneath and it did not bleed through at all.  Now my personal files look like I actually took some time to set them up correctly (or at least "correctly"  as per my definition).The Avery Company has made available free templates and software to use with their products.  I had to give them my name and email address in order to access the templates I was looking for.  The good thing is that the templates will help me utilize the labels more efficiently.  These labels are for both laser and ink jet printers and are acid free.  Included in this package was a sample pack of four repositionable note tabs.  I've used those in the past and absolutely love them.  Thanks Avery for the reminder that I need to pick up more of those.I always feel like office supplies in general are over priced.  However Avery products have always been great quality.  I have never had a problem with anything from them and this product was no different.I love to reuse file folders.  I know, file folders are pretty cheap and why bother?  Well, convenience is the main reason and not being wasteful, maybe, that's the other.  Anyway, I've developed that habit over the years and I've used my share of "tricks" to do it which include turning the folder inside out and using the other side of the tab, liquid paper, correction film, and stick-on labels.  Labels have become the preferred choice for me and that is where these improved Avery ones with their super opaque cover technology shine.Avery labels are simply the best brand you can buy.  A label isn't something that cannot be improved upon and Avery continues to be the leader in the finish of the actual label, the adhesives, and their "TrueBlock Technology" which makes the label 100% opaque to anything under it.  No more "x-ray" vision of the previous writing, or previous label, underneath makes for a neat job of folder presentation.  They feed flawlessly through all my printers, and if only printing a single the sheets will hold up extremely well for repeated trips through.  The quality is top-notch and you can use a fine point sharpie to write on and it is still crisp without the fattened bleed look to your written labels.  The adhesive never curls and I have even been able to remove them with care to simply put a new label on when I've had several to build up.This particular size is truly versatile too.  I've used them as labels on so many different items that I am addicted to having these on hand.  You can use them not just in the office, but for lots of creative labeling.  You can label audio/video cables by wrapping them around the cable, price sundry items if you have a business, label dates on items stored in your fridge or freezer, put a date you opened something such as olive oil so you know it is still usable, the list goes on.  They stick and they remain readable under  and/or heavy use conditions.  These labels are worth the money and you may find yourself addicted too.  Recommended with no reservations.These labels are good.They are wide, and they do darken out anything that was previously on the old label or written on the tab.I need a better method of printing a single label though.  I rarely print or require an entire sheet of labels like this, so while the product is good for project work, it's not the most efficient for "onesy and twosy".  Otherwise, looks good and works.I'll go into more detail about what's superior about Avery below, but first, regarding this size --These will fit three lines of 10 point Arial, or one line of something bigger. I use them regularly at work for their intended purpose, and I also use them at home to label stuff going into the freezer. They do stay on even when frozen, but are easiest to remove while still frozen. If they get wet before I try to remove the label, some adhesive has to be scrubbed off.I doubt Avery matters for the freezer application, but if you want a professional result for more traditional uses, Avery and name brand printer toner are a must.I've tried several different generic brands -- from all three big office retailers -- and the letters get smeared or flake off when applying the labels. Add generic toner, and the problem gets so bad that the printing becomes almost illegible. With generic toner these smear a little bit, but with the name brand toner (I've used these in both HPs and Canons), there's no problem. The generic labels might seem a lot cheaper, but these are well worth the extra dough.As far as True Block goes, well, I don't really care, but it does work. The labels have an opaque backing between the paper and adhesive, which doesn't allow anything below it to show through. I usually just remove the label if I'm going to re-use a file folder, because I'm just going to covering up the damaged area with another label anyway. True Block seems more useful for shipping applications than for file folders. I don't know whether or not Avery is selling these labels in a non-True Block form, but if so, it may be worth looking closely at price.I am very satisfied with these labels.  They are easy to work with and look great.The TrueBlock technology works really well.  I had some folders with old labels that I had written on with Sharpies and ballpoint pen.  I have tried using other labels to cover the old writing, but I could always see through them - especially the labels that I had written on with marker.  These folder labels blocked out the old writing completely.Avery's website also has some really nice free online tools to create quick templates for printing labels - no downloads required.  I used the "Design and Print Online" feature to create a sheet of labels on my MacBook, then I printed the sheet on my Brother laser printer.  It worked really well.  It took me less than 5 minutes to get my labels typed in, choose a font, and get them printed using the manual sheet feeder on my printer.  It was impressively easy.I was pleased to receive these as I had filing to do. I printed out a sheet of file labels, and then applied them to file folders I was re-using. I was extremely disappointed as I could see the writing right through the label, making for a very messy look. NOT recommended at all. I had to go buy new labels...As a teacher, you quickly learn how to recycle and reuse anything you can get your hands on.  This is a great way to reuse file folders.  With the True Block Technology, you can make a folder look practically new.  The labels underneath don't show through.  Of course you can use Avery's templates with this labels.  What could make it any greater?  They can be used on both Inkjet and Laser Printer.  How many times have you bought printer labels only to discover they aren't for your printer?  They even come with 2 Box Tops for Education.  Gotta love that!  Avery has done it.  The perfect label.  You are going to find a million uses for these File Folder Labels.These worked very well for me. I was able to load them in my laserjet printer and and print a variety of labels to cover up older existing labels. The labels are thicker than normal and have a grey back to help make sure there is no show through. Over all a great and did the job.Avery has accomplished exactly what they have claimed with their Ink Jet File Folder Labels. That which I am most pleased about with regard to this product is the fact that when one label is placed over another, the old label is entirely blocked out, permitting me to use and reuse my file folders. These labels may pay for themselves over time.Great labels, they cover up everything underneath so if you are like me and reuse your folders, they will work wonderfully! Highly recommend!*****I am a huge fan of Avery products, especially their new "TrueBlock Technology"--a special process that makes the label completely opaque--so that you can't see through it at all no matter what is under it. No more layering file labels on top of each other to block out old writing underneath! It is amazing and covers over everything. The labels come on sheets with 30 labels to a sheet. They are heavy duty and have a very slight chemically odor to them.I use these labels not just for file folders but for all kinds of other paperwork to block out dark writing and to cover over things to reuse them. Avery also makes file folder labels that are larger that have colors on them to be used for file folders too. I like these better even though they are just standard size (they are 2/3" by 3 7/16") because they are all white and thus are more multi-use.The labels come with free templates and software online if you use your labels in your printer, which I do not. They also come with a free sample of 4 Avery NoteTabs. These are like a combination of a Post-It note and a divider--a heavy duty stick-on removable divider tab. I really like these as well.Even though these are more expensive than labels without "TrueBlock Technology" I will still buy them because you use far fewer and they work much better. In the long run they save you both time and money, I think.Highly recommended.*****These are very high quality File Folder labels that can be printed with either an Inkjet or a Laser printer. I printed mine using a Lexmark X3350 Inkjet printer. There were no problems with the label sheet feeding through the printer. The labels hold the ink without smearing or blurring or bleeding. Furthermore, no labels detached from the sheet while moving through the printer - a disaster which has happened to me using lower quality labels. Yet they are easily peeled from the sheet when it's time to apply them. Used over an existing label or writing, they are truly opaque. Nothing shows through.About half my files are 1/3 cut Manila folders and the other half are 1/5 cut Pendaflex hanging folders. These labels are intended for the 1/3 cut folders and they work perfectly there. But I found that by restricting the text on the label to about 2 inches total width, I could easily use them on the 1/5 cut hanging folders as well. I just applied the new label to the old paper label insert and then folded over the excess.I recommend that you investigate the "Design and Print Online" feature available on Avery's website. It is far more flexible than a simple template. With it, I was able to create a text field for my labels that was short enough to fit on the 1/5 cut folders. You can select fonts, sizes, colors, styles, even add images to your labels. And you can save your layout for future use. The interface is a little strange and sometimes behaves in unexpected ways, but you'll easily enough get the hang of it with a bit of experimentation (and it has an "Undo"). I printed my first try on plain paper and then overlaid it on the label sheet to double check.The package contains 25 sheets of labels with 30 labels per sheet for a total of 750 labels. Searching Amazon, I find that there is also a 1500 label package but I don't see anything smaller than the 750 size. This is fine in a business setting, but for home use 750 labels is likely to last more than a lifetime! I'd like to see Avery offer a 150 or 180 label version for the home market.These work well and, combined with Avery's website, will get that old file cabinet orderly and organized very quickly.These are easy to work with, they stick well, and they don't smear.  What more can a person ask for?  I'd buy them if the price were competitive with what else is out there.We use these to label all of our files because they are really sticky and rarely if ever come off, and the ability to have them delivered to our doorstep with prime at a low price just makes it that much better!These are excellent to cover old file names and reuse the folders again.  They have the tru block backing, so nothing shows through the label.  These will print well on most printers.While this is a good product I had problems downloading a template to print the labels and had to call Avery customer support. While I found customer support helpful I had to speak to two people because the first technical support agent did not think this product worked in a laser printer and he had to transfer me someone who confirmed it did.I first went to the Avery website and put in my product number which brought up a bunch of information and options. One download would have added an Avery icon to Word and as I understand it a toolbar as well. I did not want this.When I tried to call Avery to figure out how to download a template that did not automatically add a toolbar to my screen the person helping me showed me what to do. I was able to save a template to word that I can use without adding any sort of icon or toolbar. I asked about using the product in my laser printer only to be told it did not work in a laser printer contrary to the packaging. When I questioned this he transferred me to another agent who confirmed it did.One concern for those who do not have massive amounts of file folder labels to print is that you can only put the labels through a printer once. If you don't use all the labels the first time you have to hand write on the remaining ones.One good thing is that there are instructions on each sheet explaining how to use the labels. While the sheet directs you to the Avery website for more information, it also includes a toll free phone number for the Consumer Service Center and another for Avery Software Support. While it took two people to address my concerns the representatives were very professional.The labels are big enough to cover old labels and there is no problem writing on them. They work fine.  I have used a couple of sheets already.Overall this is a good product. I just wish the website was a bit more user friendly but there is customer support to help people like me who have trouble navigating the website.First let me say, these are AWESOME and I am so glad I had the opportunity to try them on a trial basis because I don't think I would have forked out the almost twenty bucks on something I wasn't sure about...but I would and will gladly fork it out now knowing they work as well as Avery claims, if not better.  There are 750 in the package...but with all the uses that won't take long to use up.**QUALITY**Labels are labels, right?  Nope!  These are high quality labels that really do cover up any writing underneath, even if it was written in a broad tip Sharpie.  This is accomplished because the labels have a gray backing where the adhesive is rather than just plain white single-layer paper like most labels.  They are also a heavier weight paper than your basic labels meaning no tearing!!  They adhesive is strong enough to stay put, yet releases smoothly if you wanted to remove it...without leaving behind any torn paper or yucky sticky goo...YAY for that because I am ALWAYS reusing file folders and renaming them.**PRINTING**I have printed these using Word and [...] version of Word...both print perfectly and line up perfectly without having to adjust the template's settings at all (I usually have to adjust them by 1/8th of an inch or so to line up perfectly)...but not with these!!  I have used them in my inkjet printer without any problems as well as my laser printer.  Usually my laser printer causes paper to curl due to the heat, but these don't do that.  I often print only a few lables at a time and reuse the sheet later with some of the labels removed....I have had other labels catch and get stuck in the printer when doing this, but not with these...smooooooooth sailing!The uses for these are endless...not just for file folders.  I use them to label my kids books & toys, totes that I use for storage items, little jars I store fresh ground spices in, and other personal items....they are great for writing on too, not just printing.  The packaging Avery sells their labels in works great for storing them because it keeps the labels from bending or getting the corners torn up, yet is super easy to take a new sheet out or put one away for future use...without taking up a bunch of space.  The label is the perfect height for the tabs on hanging file folders, but it a bit too long, so I just fold it over the back and it works perfectly.  My filing cabinet now shows my OCD nature and is freakishly neat & organized thanks to Avery!  My only gripe, and this is a rather pathetic one...I wish they came in colors to match my folders...I'd even settle on just plain manila.  Then my filing cabinet would be a true work of art!!I was very impressed with this product, both in how the printing went and how well the "blocking" technology works at keeping labels located under this new label are blocked from being seen under it.The labels loaded and printed well - the blacking is substanial enough to keep the print job "straight" through without any creep to the left or the right.  The resulting labels were printed on track, without coming out cockeyed.The biggest plus for the Avery 8366 File Folder Labels is Avery's TrueBlock technology which layers a semi-opaque gray layer to the back of the label, allowing it to hide most anything you may put it on top of.  I know that for a lot of the labels I have I have to remove anything underneath as they'll show right through.  For this alone the Avery labels are great.Other than that, they're normal-looking labels that are sized to put on tab-type file folders. Unlike a different style of Avery label I reviewed earlier, Microsoft Word 2010 did not have a template for these.  Avery's web site has several options, including an 88MB program that runs independent of Word.  A smaller "helper" toolbar for Word doesn't support Word 2010.  At the basic level, a .doc file is provided which you can open in Word and fill it in, but this means you can't take advantage of automation features such as mail-merge, etc.  This is not a fault of the labels themselves, but if you're going to use these you might want to know.The instructions for the labels say to not reuse the sheet, though it seems to work anyway for at least a few passes.The Avery File Folder Labels are very nice and easy to use. Runs through my printer without any problems, no smudging, jamming or anything. I prefer these particular labels over most other brands for that reason alone.I've purchased other 'no bleed-through' labels from office supply stores and found that they fall flat on their claims. When I heard these labels were suppose to stop bleed-through, I bought a pack of folders to go with it, figuring it wouldn't work as advertised and I'd end up tossing some old files. I was shocked when they actually covered up the DARK writing underneath. I often use a very thick, black marker for writing on some folders, and these labels didn't allow the original writing to bleed through at all. Very impressive.If you are resusing old file folder these are the absolute best.  There is NO bleed through of whatever is written behind it, even if written in dark black sharpie.The labels have some sort of coating on the back that really does block everything out.You can quickly find a template in Word by typing in 8366 in the search box after you do "File" "New".When using these templates I always select the whole document and have the edges of the cells of the tables filled in so that I can tell where the edge of the label is while typing ( In Word 2007 this is under the Home tab in the Paragraph section, it looks like a little 4 square box with the bottom underlined).  Chose "All borders".  You can then go back and Chose "No borders" when done if you do not want the borders printed.We bought these initially for our daughter's first birthday party a few years ago, and we were very happy with its ease of use and professional look.  Since then, we've used it on just about every event we send invitations for.  In addition, we've also used these to print labels for just about anything (plain shoe boxes, photo boxes, labels on back of pictures, gift bags, and fancy name tags for drinking glasses/cups at parties).Because it is clear, it can go on any color of envelope (except the dark ones).  Labels printed fine on our inkjet printers (HP Deskjet PSC 750, Canon Pixma MX870, Epson Artisan 810) in black & white and in color, and the results were excellent.  I've used it on laserjets as well (HP Color LJ 3550 and HP 2420), and it prints fine.  I just let the printed product sit a few minutes, just in case the laserjet ink was still wet (I've actually tried to smudge a few labels after printing on a laserjet, and the ink did NOT smudge at all).  The results were just as good as the deskjet printed set.  Word 2003 and 2007 has the proper template for this product.  The template for Word XP and Word 2000 can be downloaded from [...].The labels are easy to peel, thanks to the pop-up edge for easy peeling.  Because they are clear, they are virtually invisible when applied to almost any colored surfaces.  This gives the finished product a professional look without the professional price.Though we've gone through many of these over the years, I've only just got to write a review for this recently.  I highly recommend this product.Avery Labels have been a part of my mailings for various events for over two decades. But this is the first time I've ever used the clear versions and I have to say, this is a darn good product and I'd probably buy more.The labels do smudge rather easily and this might be difficult to see when the labels are still on the carrier sheet,  but you can see the smudges kind of easily after they are stuck down on your envelopes, so a bit of care and clean hands are needed when doing large mailings.The ink from my printer dried pretty quickly on these labels and it seemed more crisp (with no ink spread) than others I've used and they ran through my printer with zero problems.These labels peel fairly easily off the carrier sheet and the transparent label stock looks great on various kinds of envelopes, colors and textures which makes it seem like the label is made of the same material as your surface at first glance.As others here have written you can also use these for handwritten labeling as well as machine labeling and the quantity is enough for most basic mailings or labeling jobs. A great product, but a little pricey for those on a budget.The AVERY CLEAR ADDRESS LABELS 8660 are really easy to use. If you have MS WORD, you can just go to labels, select the #8660 and start typing away. You can create one label or a whole sheet of labels with the same or different addresses. If you don't have MS WORD you can go to Avery's website and download templates for Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, or InDesign. Don't have any of those programs, no problem because you can download -- for free -- Avery's "Designer Pro" for either Mac or PC and you can design in that program.Since the labels are clear, the typeface will stand out from the background color of the envelope and looks really elegant even if you're using white colored envelopes.They're easy to peel off and stick securely, and if you have an odd sized or shaped envelope, you don't have to fight with the printer to accept it and risk ruining as it goes through the feeder. You just print on the label and then fix it to the envelope.Avery also has pre-designed templates that feature clip art on the labels that you can download, also for free, so you can make personalized invitations or holiday cards etc.I highly recommend AVERY LABELS 8660 for ease of use and professional looking quality.If you need a label where you don't want the background to show, then then these lables are for you.  Believe it or not, I use these labels for my home brew beer bottles.  With a clear label I can make a custom made label on my carefully crafted home brew that makes me look like a brewing professional.  No more white background on my beer bottles.  No sir - now my beer bottles look professional.  Kidding aside I love these clear labels and recommend them to those who wish to hide the background.Use a template to easily print clear address labels.  These may smear if you touch them while they're wet, but that's true of paper labels, too, so it pays to be careful after they're done.  Very handy, attractive labels.I love these clear labels; you can't even see them when they are affixed to an envelope or to anything else.  And they are for ink jet printers; therefore, I can run these through my printers, and instantly have address labels, or labels for boxes, or for whatever I need/want them for.These labels are awesome, and they make life so much easier.And, these labels are wonderful for cosmetic reasons.  They are clear.These labels were easy to use. They printed out with no problems. I would purchase these when next in need of address labels.I like that fact that these are clear.  When putting on a colored envelope they look super.These labels are excellent -- 100% clear.PROS:--Sticky but easily removable--Labels are lightweight and thin--Labels look sleek/high qualityCONS:--Labels are a bit delicate--Price is highIf you are in need of clear labels, these are a great option!Being from Avery, these worked perfectly in Word's built-in template for the Avery 5160 label.  Alignment was consistent throughout the whole page.These labels should not really be labeled clear, though.  They are more of a matte transparent material, similar to tissue paper.  When placed on white envelopes, etc., they do disappear -- sort of like Scotch Magic tape.  If you were expecting some kind of clear plastic, though, these aren't it.The Easy Peel is a great feature to just remove a label or two without crinkling up the whole page which you know will lead to paper jams and/or smudges if you need to run it through the printer again.  It is also easy and a time-saver.  This is an excellent feature.Also, I ran a few labels twice through my Epson ink jet printer.  The ink appears to dry like on paper, and there was no smudging even when I tried with my finger.  I would also rank the adhesive above average stick.My only reason for 4 stars is that it is not really clear.  It is a matte light white transparent.  Depending on what you put it on (color/finish), you may get a different appearance.There are no Avery templates for iPages, so if you have a Mac your out of luck unless you use MS Office.Seriously, does anybody really print out labels and stick them to envelopes anymore?  Don't all printers take envelopes these days?I guess if you need to print labels these are a lot better than white labels.  They stick well.I wanted these labels for an alternate use. I am getting married in October, and I thought rather than just tying a ribbon around them, I would make personalized labels for them. I figured address labels would be a good size, and when I saw the clear ones, I thought they look better than the solid white ones.I thought wrong. These did not work for my purpose AT ALL. The clear showed air pockets on the bubble containers, and (even after letting the labels dry overnight) when I tried to smooth them out, there was some smudging. Even the slightest bit of moisture smears the labels, which isn't really a good idea for something that is going to hold bubbles. (See my customer images.)However, much like that guy my Grandmother set me up with when I was in college, this stuff is great on paper. I guess I can't fault it for not working on an item that is not its intended use.Luckily, I also ordered theAvery Easy Peel 1 x 2 5/8 Inch Clear Address Labels, and those worked perfectly.What's good and new:1) These labels are as close to being completely invisible as possible in a label.  They are matte-satin finished and print out beautifully on both inkjet and laser printers.  The copier and writing in ballpoint pen works well too.2) Avery Label templates are already in many common off-the-shelf word processing softwares.  If your company has its own specialized word processor, the Avery template can be downloaded from their website and easily adapted to run on it.  Label measurements are also easily found if a new template needs to be created from scratch.3) The templates are easy to use and understand.4) The instructions in the package itself are clear and easy to understand and markings help the correct insertion of the label page into the printer/copier.5) Ink dries quickly.and the best new feature?6) The easy tear feature which allows a) half-sheet printing and b) easy label removal from the sheet.  As warmth from a printer or copier heat up the glue on the labels, a sheet can only be run a certain number of times before there are runner marks on the label and the adhesive starts to denature from heat, affecting stickiness and colour (yellowing).  Half-sheet printing enables maximum use of the labels as well as making them easier to peel off the sheet.I've been using Avery labels for years, primarily to make my own return address labels and as someone that sends out a lot of SASE, it saves a lot of time. Avery's Easy Peel makes their address labels that much easier to use. I use Microsoft Word to print labels. Word has templates for labels, so once you find 8660, enter your text and hit print. The clear address label does go on completely clear, which would especially be useful when using high quality paper, such as sending out wedding invitations.These labels work well with my 5 year old HP inkjet printer and dry time is fast.  The clear labels allow you to use non-white envelopes with a very professional look.  (offwhite)Super easy to use!  Easy to print, easy to peel off and use!  The ink doesn't wipe off easily which is a huge perk!I used these labels to make address labels for my save the dates.  They were easy to use in the printer and align.  They look great: crisp and clear.  And they do not appear to smudge easily.  And the easy peel feature makes adhereing them quite easy.  All in all, a great product for mailings.I love these clear labels- Avery is always top-notch. Printing on them is easy- Avery's site provides four ways that you can design and print the labels. I used the "Avery Design and Print Online"- no downloads required. You can also download the templates to use in Word or on other programs. Anyway, Avery online has lots of designs and it's simple to use, so all I had to do was type in my address and print the labels. They dry right away and the print did not smear at all. Highly recommended product!Overall, I'm very satisfied with these.  I originally had thought I'd use them for individual labeling of mail, however, my software doesn't allow for single print of labels.  So, I initially wasted an entire sheet when the address printed on all the labels.So, I've gone to using them for my return labels.  I use a Canon M83 color printer and they come out just fine.  I will say that "virtually disappear" is a pretty big stretch...to me the labels are still very visible even though they are clear.Every once in a while, I try the store-brand and usually they are fine.  (I still have some from Biz-Mart... anybody remember them?!)But these seem to a) hold the printing better, b) peel easier,  c) jam a lot less.Very glad to get them!I have to give this product 3 stars because these labels are not "super clear" more closer to "clear-frost".  My definition of "Clear" is, whether the envelope is pure white or colored, you should be able to apply this label and unless you catch the address at just the right angle, you may or may not see a glossiness where the label has been affixed.Why is this such an important point??  Well, we used these labels for our wedding invitations and RSVP cards.  We spent top-dollar on some premium cream-white envelopes and expecting the label to mostly vanish since it was clear, it did not.  It leaves a "clear-frosted" solid-rectangle of the entire label.  I've seen other types of "super-clear" labels and you can barely see the edge of the label and the rest of the "truly transparent" label simply vanishes, except for the printed address.  These exact labels are not like that, they are not truly transparent.  We felt the appearance "cheapend" our hard work on the invitations and premium envelopes we purchased.  We felt it was somewhat false advertising for the 'clear' part.Also on the easy peel part, these labels were no easier to unpeel than any others we've used, in fact, all of the constant "easy peeling" somewhat crinkles the rest of the labels.  The description for this product says, "... bend the sheet to expose the trademarked Pop-up Edge for fast peeling and fold the sheet back to flat" - yea, do this 20 times and you'll no doubt have crinkles in your other labels.  So I somewhat disagree with the "easy peel" marketing.###So my rating of 3 stars is for my comments above, the rest of my review is to help out fellow Amazon-ers and is NOT related to the 3 stars above:########################Note: if you are using these with standard white envelopes, yes you'll be fine, just be forewarned if you use non-white envelopes.I did ruin 2 sheets because they misfed, even though they were perfectly aligned in the paper tray, so I'm not blaming Avery, as it could have been the printer's paper-feed mechanism.  To save you from ruining a sheet, I found the best way is to select Manual Feed and print only ONE sheet at a time; do not load multiple sheets as they could get misfed.  Once we loaded one sheet at a time, we were fine.  I was careful not to force the paper into the paper-feed, rather, allow the printer to gently pull the individual page of labels.I did use the 8660 code inside of Microsoft Word and the template of labels was a perfect fit when printed (and when I fed the labels correctly).I love the convenience of the Avery Easy Peel labels. Works perfectly with my printer to create the address labels I need and the clear labels lend a nice look to the label. Highly recommend!I just finished using the Avery Easy Peel clear address labels for my daughter's birthday invitations. Not only were they easy to print, the labels can be removed easily. When on the envelope they practically disappear; they are truly clear. I highly recommend this product for anyone using address labels but want it to look like the type is right on the envelope. They are perfect!The Avery easy peel labels are a great way to print out formal invitations.  The clear labels are wonderful for giving your envelopes the appearance of being stamped or printed on without the cost.  The software download allows you to easily print full sheets of labels from Microsoft Office products with a variety of fonts for a unique formal appearance.  In the past one of the big flaws with these labels was the difficulty of trying to peel them off of the sheet (especially when you have dozens of labels to peel!).  These new labels have an "easy peel" design which makes it much easier and faster to peel off the sheet.  Overall this a great product for anyone needing to mail a large quantity of letters or invitations.*** Positive Points: ***- Great results from a variety of inkjet printers (I used an Epson Artrisan 810 and HP inkjet printer)- New easy peel design really does work- Looks great on formal invitations or letters*** Negative Points: ***- NoneAvery labels haven't let me down for all the years I've been using them.  Besides the obvious return labels, I've used them for labelling water pipes in the basement, birthday party gift bags, folders.  They stick well, print well, and are templates for various printing softwares (I've been a PrintShop user for a very long time, occasionally use Microsoft Word, and use Avery DesignPro5).  DH redid the pipes in the basement 10 years ago and figured it would be best to label them right off the bat, direction, hot or cold, where to, so I did some up in PrintShop.  They haven't fallen off, they haven't faded.  We also have a hub of cable wires that needed labelling, and Avery did that job as well.  Many uses for me, besides the obvious.The labels are semi-transparent white on the sheet, but clear once adhered to the surface.  The dilemma I always have with these types of labels is that I just want to print one or a small handful, but the sheet has 30 and I don't want to waste the rest.  One reviewer had a good suggestion to tape a piece of paper over the labels that you don't want to use up.  I find that sometimes if I don't do this carefully it will jam the printer.  So another trick that I discovered is:1. Make a layout in the software for a small number of labels.2. Print onto a blank sheet of paper.3. Put the Avery labels over the printed test sheet, hold up to a strong light source, and see how it lines up.4. Make adjustments in the software for the alignment, repeat steps 2-4.5. Print to the Avery sheet.I use these labels to do marketing campaigns for my small landscaping business, and I was so impressed with how crisp and clean they look. The clear color of the labels is great for "natural" envelopes that have those little threads in them, or colored envelopes or postcards, so you get an attractive look.Some clear labels look kind of yellowed to me, but these don't. They are as clear as I expect a sticky label can be. I am really not seeing any color to the label itself, though I am not sure I'd bother using a clear label on a bright white surface because if you had a piece of dust or something get stuck to a clear label it wouldn't look cute.These labels didn't smudge, and have an attractive matte surface that took ink well.The only stickers on the sheet are the labels themselves, so they are super easy to peel off, and you aren't left with any stupid little bits sticking to your fingers once you're nearly done using the sheet of labels. I really love that new design.The labels also went through my printer with no issue. I was worried that because they've eliminated that outer quarter inch of excess label and just left the labels themselves on the sheet, that the sheets might get stuck in my printer or not feed as well. To test how they fed, I loaded in a stack of labels instead of feeding them one at a time as I used to. I needn't have worried, my printer took up each sheet with no difficulty and no jamming and printed out beautiful address labels.I'm very happy with the quality here. They've really managed to eliminate everything I find annoying about printer labels. Everything about these is perfect.These labels are made to be used on your printer with the Avery Template, and the results are spectacular! However, we find LOTS of other uses for them! I use black marker on the labels (labels do not mar, and easily peel off) to put on our kids dresser drawers so they cannot say they "don't know where it goes" when its time to pick up/clean up! (NEXT, we need to work on neatness INSIDE the drawers!) I also use them on canning jars and they stick great, were easy to read, and, again, they came off neatly (no GOO Gone needed!) One of my favorite uses is for items put in the fridge, or freezer! I NEVER remember WHAT that stuff IS in there, or WHEN it got put in there! And someone around here (everyone takes credit) thought of using them to put instructions on the laundry ("Medium Starch") and the dry cleaning ("firm creases") so no more EXCUSES - ANYONE can stop at the cleaners! These VERSATILE, economical labels are a real find!These are pretty basic adress labels.They are quite thin, matte finish and transparent material, much like the usual tape for wrapping holiday gifts.I have no problem with them, but the price is a little high for labels of such average quality. It isn't a product I'd buy again.I don't think the cost is worth the product and is not something I'd recommend. I'm also miffed as why we can't manufacture such simple paper products here in the US.Yes, gives a crisp, tight look to things like wedding invitations ... will STICK OUT from the rest of the average person's junk mail.These clear 1x2-5/8 labels are perfect for doing formal invitations - weddings, reunions, aniversaries, etc - any application where you have a premade invitation and an address database where the outer envelope is colored and would look like junk mail with a white mailing label attached.The clear label allows the post office to scan the address reliably (provided its not a halloween party invite with black envelopes - zero contrast there!) and does not detract from the looks of the printed, often formal, invitations.Additionally they can be used for everyday use on business envelopes.  As usual, Avery provides templates for all of their products.The last use that we have for this label is making wire markers out of them - you print only on the right side, and rotate to print vertically the wire number.  The label is then wrapped around the wire and around itself with the printing being the last layer.  When dealing with complex designs on paper, this makes for a very supportable product since every termination is professionally labeled and matches the design schematics.Seems we never have enough labels around here, between sending out invitations to one party or another or my new writer sending cards to family (I like to print out sheets of addresses she can easily put on an envelope by herself whens he has a letter ready to mail since she's only 6 and sometimes her writing can be a bit hard to read this way she can put one on and an envelope with a stamp and put it in the mail box herself, this has greatly increased her reading and writing by being penpals with all our out of state relatives). My daughter also loves to make her own stickers, when she was smaller the white labels worked fine but now that she's older she doesn't want everything to have a white rectangle around it and these clear labels are perfect, she can use colorful gel pens and draw her little images and then when she puts her "sticker" on something only her drawing shows! They print wonderfully in my canon printer and line up just perfectly. Great purchase!These labels are perfect for any or multi-colored designs you want for identification, addressing or application add-ons.Easy to use, just great and clear backing is good for any solid color page application.  They are my favorite for multipurpose uses.The look of these labels is great, however they do not adhere very well.  They tend to peel up on their own when used on bubble envelopes. They print well in laser printer.  I would not buy these again due to worry over the labels falling off during shipping.I received these labels and the first thing I did was print out a page of address labels with my own information on them to test the quality. The printer was able to feed the label paper through the printer with no issues. Printing in economy wasn't the best idea as it was faint. I reprinted the labels using standard ink quality and everything came out perfect. Text was centered on the labels as it should be, no jams, no label's peeling off in the printer. These work well.I actually used another version of this label a few years back on my wedding invitations to create custom return address labels and saved a ton of money over ordering custom labels from some company. These labels match the quality and I could easily recommend using these for anything from mailing bills to mailing wedding invitations, they do a great job and the quality of the label is really good.The Avery Easy Peel 1 x 2 5/8 Inch Clear Address Label 750 Count (8660) are fabulous labels which have given me no problems.  I've written on some with a Sharpie for quick labeling (save those extras if you don't print all on a sheet) and printed in both color and black with no smudging.  Love my Canon printers with genuine Canon ink.  The Avery website offers great designing hints and templates, particularly for those of us who use a Mac.  Microsoft Office also contains templates, but I really enjoy using Design Pro from the website.  These clear labels are really and truly clear when applied, and they are extremely easy to remove from the sheet.  I'll warn you, though, be careful if you are applying in a less than clean environment, as dust, dirt and animal hairs can be pressed onto your otherwise pristine document, destroying your otherwise favorable impression.  No need to have labels professionally printed with this product, you can do it yourself if you have the time.Just tried out these labels on a mailing that I did. They work as advertised producing a clear, clean label that is easy to place and read. You can't go wrong with Avery labels.For the past five years Avery's clear address labels have been my preferred label for all my address label needs.  I like them because they're clear and can be put on any color envelope and not stick out like a sore thumb.  Printing on these labels is a snap.  I've never had any issues with them not printing nicely or getting stuck in the printer.  The new easy peel feature is a nice addition.  By simply bending back a column of the sheet you can easily access the edge of all the labels in the column for easy peeling and application.These labels can be used for more than just mailing.  We've used them to label plastic containers and school projects.These labels worked out very well.  We used them for address and return address labels.  I tried both color and black writing.  They came out of the printer clear and did not smudge.  They stick easily and are nice and clear, making them appropriate for any color envelope.  Easy to peel off of the backing.  I would reccomend these labels for any label uses.I would give these a 4.5 rating if I could.  The lost half point is because I too often think that I printed out my labels wrong because of the little extra bit provided to make the peel off easier.  This part stays behind on the sheet.  Unless I look real close, I can't tell if I printed the labels right or not.  If I used these all the time, I'm sure this would stop being an issue, as I would adjust to it.Aside from the little side thing, these labels are great!  Easy to use, look amazing & professional thanks to being clear.  They stick really good.  They do exactly what they are supposed to do.Recommended!If you're doing a lot of labeling, this product makes it a lot easier to get the labels started.  Not much more expensive than the originals, and I think it's worth the extra couple bucks for the convenience.  Printing comes out fine on the paper, as well, and being clear, they should work really nicely with colored envelopes at Christmas.Great labels.  They are a ease to load.  Print well and they stick even better.  The clear background gives your work the look of professionalism.  The price point is right.  All around perfect addition to any office.I love using clear labels on things I like to look really nice. We used these on graduation invitations. I really like Avery labels, as I've never had a problem setting them up to print properly. The print comes out where it should on the label and they look very nice - especially when you can't see them - like with these clear labels.A lot of clear labels still have problems with ink jet printers, jamming and smudges for example.  But these labels presented none of those challenges.  I'm especially pleased with the lack of smudging!Back in the day... my Dad used to use one of those old Dyno labelmakers to label all of his tools etc.  And I thought that was cute, but a little strange.  I guess that my grandkids will start feeling the same way about how I'm now labelling stuff with these.  ;-)I use several types of labels when mailing, shipping or just labeling items. These I use for printing out mailing labels, labeling household items and as easy to write on folder labels. They leave a neater appearance than colored labels. I don't find that I crinkle the remaining labels on the page like others have commented on. They have a nice look and the ink does not smudge when I put the printed labels on anything. The labels do the job that they were intended to do. They are also good for using to tape things that might require a stronger connection than regular tape can give and they release easier than tape because of their thickness.I think these labels are a very good all purpose label, not just for an inkjet printer, as you can use these by hand too.Not only to label file folders,or to label cd cases, but I would also use these for just about anything I want to label, like when I buy something in bulk and freeze it.  I always like to label what the item is, as well as when I froze it.These labels look white, but when you peel them off they are clear.  You can use either a pen or marker on them.The label size is ample, so you can write what you need to on it.  I have some labels just like this, but they are white.  I think I prefer these clear labels.I did find them alittle hard to see where one label ends, and another one begins.  I like that they come in a pack of 750.  I doubt I will have to buy anymore of this size label in my lifetime.Iam very happy with these labels.I've used these to print a few sheets of return-address labels, and I really like them.Ease of peel: Almost perfect. They do come off easily, but not so easily I can bend the paper back and get 10 off at once. For single-label removing it's great. Tearing off the side leaves a tiny bit of each label free, enough for you to grab so you don't have to scrape off every label.Look: I love how they are translucent. The ink stands out nice and sharp, and the address seems more clear. It looks professional and pretty.Printing: (HP LaserJet) No problems. I was surprised at how crisp the ink was, and how there was no smudging right after it came off the printer. (I'm used to getting ink on my fingers.) Also, using the 'Mailing Labels' 'US Letter Small' presets printing from Address Book (on a Mac) the labels were all printed right (makes my life easier).Price: There are labels you can get for half the price. If you do a lot of printing these may not be economical. But if it's for rather infrequent use, I favor the performance and look of these labels over saving a few dollars.I recommend giving them a try.I often buy colored envelopes because I think they look so nice when you get them in a stack of mostly white mail. But if you want to use labels, the white rectangles look so ugly. These are perfect! I find they don't stick quite as well as the white ones, but never had one come off and get returned.They don't really help with dark colored paper (including most reds) because the black ink doesn't stand out enough), but for pastels or off whites, they are beautiful.She said:The ability to remove a single label from the sheet is absolutely wonderful.  The sheet then goes back through the printer without a problem, so you can print one label or a few labels as needed without waste.The tooth works perfectly on inkjet printers.  You can print inkjet lapels in color or black and white and they come out as well as the printer is capable of producing an ink output.But the best thing that the labels have is exactly what they advertise, the "Easy Peel".  Peel one label off a sheet, and keep the rest on the sheet.We will buy the easy peel labels even if they are somewhat more than the competition.This is the second type of "Easy Peel" label I've tried from Avery.  I'm now officially a fan.  The sheet of labels has three pre-scored "lines" where it folds.  Print your labels, fold along one of the lines, and the edges of ten of the labels are quickly exposed to make peeling super easy.  This might not make a difference if you are only printing a few labels, but it could be a nice time saver if you are doing a mass mailing.  It was particularly nice with these very thin clear labels.One other side note...These labels are for inkjet printers.  Be sure to get the type of labels that are designed for your printer (inkjet labels for inkjet printers, laser labels for laser printers).  In the past, I have made the mistake of using the wrong type of labels in a printer, and I believe that it caused some damage.  Don't make that mistake.  These Avery INKJET labels worked just great in my older HP 7760 inkjet printer.So...my sister decided that she didn't want to hand address 200+ wedding invitations.  There clear labels worked well for the invitations and didn't look at office like.  They printed without jamming in both the manual and auto feed trays of my Canon inkjet printer.  The ink also didn't smear when you touched it immediately after printing, however it will smear if it gets wet but is still legible.  The easy peel feature was nice, but then again I've never had an issue peeling address labels off a sheet before, and I usually fold the normal sheets along the edge just like you are instructed to do with the easy peel sheets.You know the feeling... after you get used to using a product for a long time...the manufacturer either discontinues it or takes a few shortcuts to cut costs and it just doesn't work like it used to??I get that feeling a lot.  BUT, not with Avery products.  It is one brand that I feel I can trust to deliver a quality product time after time.The clear labels were no exception.  They work great and look good.Our town's energy committee recently had a project for which we needed about 250 peel-off labels.  Our plan was to distribute 250 CFL (compact fluorescent) light bulbs free at our town's community day (sort of like a street fair) in order to encourage people to use the bulbs to reduce electricity use.  CFL light bulbs can save about 75 percent on electricity over incandescent bulbs.  For the 250 bulbs, we calculated that for 8000 hours of use and an electric cost of $0.10/KWh the total savings vs. 100 watt incandescent bulbs for all the bulbs would be about $15,000.  There would also be a saving of 94 tons of carbon dioxide emission.Avery Address Labels were a good choice for adding a label indicating the savings for using the bulbs and our committee's name.  The question was how to get the information printed on the labels.  At the Avery web site, I found free software, DesignPro, which makes it possible to produce label designs for different label sizes.  I downloaded the software easily and got started on the designFor the labels, there were about a dozen pre-made templates for the different size labels.  I chose the template that matched my labels.  Using DesignPro was a little like using PowerPoint.  I was able to cut and paste a graphics image, add the appropriate text, and choose a font for the text.  A test run on my printer produced a beautiful matrix of labels.  The only problem was to find out which side of the label stock had to be up.  I can never remember.  After an up/down test, I had my sheets of labels printed in no time.Our community day give-away was a big success.  Our free light bulbs lasted about four hours.  We were able to peel the labels from the printed sheets easily. There was enough time to peel and apply the labels as we gave away the CFLs.  One surprise is that we had to have a sales pitch even for give-aways.  The other surprise was that many people had never seen CFLs before.  I am now a big fan of Avery labels, but I recommend getting the free software to make them work.I received this product through the Amazon Vine program.  As with all Avery Products, an easy to use template is available on their website for using their products.  Since I use Office Products, I used the Word template.I found the template to be easy to use and was able to export my mailing list so that I could print my labels with no issue.  The nice part about these labels is that they essentially disappear onto the envelope that you are using so only the printing really shows up.  This makes it look as if you had inserted the envelope into a typewritter (anyone out there besides me remember those?) and printed out the address.The only caution I have has to do with inkjet printers in general and that is to be careful about getting your label wet as the print will run.  My early solution to this problem was to put a piece of clear shipping tape over the label.  My current method of dealing with this is to use a Kodak Printer as their ink will not run or smear when it gets wet.I gave this product a 4 star instead of 5 star as I still find the labels difficult to remove from the sheet if you only print one or two labels.  While bending the page works to release a label, it also generally loosens the adjoining label.  Also, you need to be careful how far you bend the sheet if you are planning to re-insert the sheet to print more labels out at a later date.I would definately recommend these labels if you are looking for a professional looking address label.These clear, matte finish labels from Avery work great in my HP 1610 inkjet printer.  Text comes out crisp and clear.  I do recommend letting them dry for a while before handling them, as with anything else you print.  These are not crystal clear, nor are they glossy, but they are clear enough that if you're putting them on a colored envelope, the color will show through.  I like the matte finish because it makes the label blend in with the paper, almost to the point that it looks like the text is printed directly on the paper.I downloaded the template from Avery's web site.  It's in Microsoft Word format but it works flawlessly with OpenOffice.These clear labels can be used for a variety of projects, particularly in the Arts & Craftscategory. You can affix them to a bare wood surface, making sure to burnish the labelssecurely, then apply clear finish on top. I've found that they work very well for (of allthings) custom guitar work. It's relatively easy to create your own headstock logo design,and a few coats of clear finish will make them look almost as good as a decal. I have hadno problems with the ink reacting negatively with lacquer or poly finishes. The main pointis that you do not want to burnish the labels directly, as the ink will rub off. Acetateor some similar material should be placed on top before burnishing. I used a graphic artstype burnisher tool, but you could improvise to see what works best for you. Of course,this is only one idea, but the versatility of these Avery labels makes them a good buy.This label is specified to ink-jets, but they work just fine on laser print too. Consistent die-cut quality keeps the sheet integrity together for multiple printer passes.The following is my fianc&eacute;e's review of the labels.My fianc&eacute; and I used these labels for our Save the Date postcards for our wedding.  We put all of the addresses in Excel and we were able to easily transfer it to Word for the template for the labels.  It was fairly easy to figure out the template for the labels.  When they printed out, they looked really good.  There was a small problem with some of the labels - they printed out off center.  I'm not sure if this is because of the template or because of the printer.  I simply moved them over in the document and they printed out okay.  About three out of 100 labels were messed up.  I recommend these labels.  I'm happy that we chose these labels for our Save the Dates.  When I put them on the postcards, they looked really good =)I always requested Avery labels at the office - they are extremely easy to print and apply.  I recently used these for a huge batch of cards and LOVE them.  We ordered ivory envelopes so we needed clear labels and these were perfect!  They are easy to print and the "easy peel" feature really makes applying them go much more quickly.  I'll definitely use these again for our holiday cards!The Avery Easy Peel labels are really easy to work with.  My inkjet ink doesn't smudge and the labels are super easy to peel.  I highly recommend them.I have had negative experiences with "generic" printable labels in the past...specifically, with the sheet getting stuck in my ink jet printer.  I have had no problems at all with these Avery labels. They go through the printer smoothly. The labels are easy to peel off the sheet as well.  I have also used these same labels in the white version, which work equally well.  However, for purely aesthetic reasons, I prefer the clear labels.If you go online to the Avery website, there is a free software download that allows you to customize the labels to your liking.This size of address label has many uses.  Of course, they can be used for addresses on packages and envelopes, but also as identification labels.  I printed a sheet with my name, address and phone number to attach to things I take on vacation.  The print on my inkjet printer was clean and crisp, the ink dried quickly (no smudging), the labels indeed do peel easily and I like the translucent background that works with many surfaces.  Word 2010 had the format in its list of labels and each label was perfectly aligned.  You can also download free templates from Avery's web site.The main reason I like these labels:  1.  Easy to use with my software programs.  2.  Print out perfect!  3.  Was able to put a clip art on them.  4.  Last reason but the best of all.  They peel off so very easy. I have to add that the Avery Labels have found so many uses from address labels,for file folders,  recipe headings, journaling, labeling totes and I'm sure I will find other places to use them.  I haven't found anything negative about these labels and usually I don't like using them because they are hard to peel off.These print very crisply on my laser (I realize this is supposed to be for inkjet).  The claim that these are invisible is not true...  You can see it.. and on white paper, it looks like a white label.  But I think it would be impossible for it to be invisible as claimed.  Otherwise, it is excellent.  High qualityI use this size label not only for addressees, but also to print my own return address labels. Being a pen pal, I've seen plenty of professionally-printed clear address labels. On those, the ink sits on top of glossy, clear "paper" and scuffs right off during shipping. Those address labels are almost always illegible by the time they get to me. And what's the point of an address label if the address chips right off?These labels are different, though, because they're textured and have more of a matte finish. While they aren't completely "invisible" and can still be seen when put on an envelope, they give a nice, professional look that white labels don't necessarily give. It also is surprising that an InkJet printer has the ability to do this type of printing and not smear off. (Note: These aren't colorfast, however. If they get wet, the ink can smear off.)As a handy feature for removal, the backing paper can be bent, exposing just one narrow edge on the right side of each label.The only real problem I have is that my printer isn't always reliable in "seizing" this type of paper, sometimes ending up in a wasted sheet. That's more of a potential issue with certain printers, though.Avery always makes great labels and gives you the best templates and software to go with them, so it's no surprise that I'm very pleased with their clear easy-peel address labels. The healthy 1" x 2 5/8" size allows for plenty of font choices.I use tan parchment-colored envelopes for my business and slapping a white label on them gives a second-class mail look.  The clear labels impart a more professional appearance, and while I don't know it to be a fact, I think recipients are far more likely to pay attention.Finally, the easy peel feature prevents both frustration and inappropriate words in the office. Highly recommended.Avery labels (the white paper ones) have been a staple at my desk and in my kitchen for years.  I use them multiple ways: there's always the address label for the few snail mail pieces I still send, then there are file folders for the actual paperwork I still file manually, instead of digitally, but it's the other stuff where I really put these to use - they're perfect for labeling Mason jars after you've processed that summer harvest of peaches and figs, I've used them to label bakery boxes of cookies I've baked and taken to meetings (I have a set pre-printed with the names and ingredients of various cookie recipes I bake frequently), they're a snap to slap on a jar or Tupperware container filled with arborio rice you'd like to distinguish from the basmati in the container next to it on the shelf and they make figuring out which computer cable goes to which peripheral a snap.These clear labels are even better than the white ones.  They're advertised as clear - don't expect shiny-clear, like a piece of cellophane tape.  Instead, they've got somewhat of a mildly-milky matte finish, like Scotch brand Magic Tape, that doesn't exactly disappear when applied to surfaces.  That's hardly a negative, however, as they stick much better than the white ones - I'll be using these from now on for Mason jars and other goodies in the pantry.  These also seem sturdier...I expect they'll stand up to wear better than the white paper-based labels.Finally, Avery has done a nifty little improvement to the base papers these labels are mounted on: just a small bend in the paper causes the edge of the label to pop up and makes removing them a snap!  You can easily extract a single label without bothering any of the others.Against truly dark items (do you really mail things in black envelopes all that often?) with dark printing on the label may be the only time you'll need to use a paper-based label instead; the contrast in that situation may simply not be enough to read the label easily.With that one exception, I expect I'll be using these labels often and to good effect.  Recommended.Avery Easy Peel 1 x 2 5/8 Clear label gives any envelope a professional look.  It is of the standard address size, but can be used to label items such as dvds, boxes, etc.  I prefer the clear labels to others, as they give a neat effect on birthday card envelopes.  I actually use the clear shipping ones for this purpose.  My word processsor, which is Word Perfect, includes a template for this label. Avery makes quality labels, and you can't go wrong with these.I like these clear labels.  They print up easily and look great on all envelopes.  I am currently using them for business, but they would work well for personal items as well.  Especially invitations as they would make it elegant being that they are clear.  Easy to use, print is clear and dark.I LOVE these labels.  The surface is a sort of matte texture, making them almost disappear when placed on an envelope.  Printing on an inkjet printer yields sharp and smearless results. They look a lot classier on an envelope than the standard white mailing labels.These are useful not only for mailing, but for labeling almost anything.  I will still use my label maker for stuff that gets a lot of abuse or get wet (like soccer balls and drink cups) but these are much more discrete for labeling other possessions.I keep a three ring binder filled with printed address labels stored in slash pocket folders with tabs (labeled with a sample label)for the addresses I use frequently.  However, when sending something nice like a birthday card I was never pleased with the way the white labelss looked.  These solve my problem.  I printed up a sheet for all my favorite addresses and stuck them in my binder for use on more formal mail.  I also printed up a sheet with "Fragile, do not bend" for when I mail photos.  Since they are clear it is easier to find a spot to put them without covering up addresses.I have avoided clear labels in the past due to problems with them jamming the printer, clumping up when you try to peel them and generally being difficult to work with in every way.  These labels are much, much better than the previous clear labels and simply work.We bought these to use on our save-the-date cards and wedding invitations, and they worked out great. Just the right size for regular envelopes, and the look was exactly what we were going for.One suggestion - if you're not using the whole page of labels, and want to use the remaining labels later, take a piece of white paper, and tape it over the labels you are not using. The labels get darker every time you run them through the printer. It's hard to notice on the page, but once you affix them to the envelope, they can look a bit dirty.I found these easy to use with my HP printer.  They dried pretty much instantly and I had no problems with smudging at all.  Once printed, the labels are simple to remove and did not tear.  These are a must have if you're wanting to put labels on colored envelopes or otherwise want a nicer finish than a colored or more visible label.  These work great!I've used Avery labels for years including the laser version of 8660 until recently when my laser all-in-one bit the dust.  I was pleased to have this product come up in the Vine Newsletter since I replaced my laser with an Epson 810 inkjet all in one.  I also just ran out of pre-printed labels of all sorts (including the freebees and the donate bait).The 8660 is a standard label in MS Word and Open Office, and that glable in UBUNTU supported them as well.  Software - no sweat (besides they have free stuff on the web) and I had plenty of options (besides I'd already set up the laser version)I slipped a sheet of these in the Epson and fired off a page of return address labels.  They worked like a charm, positioned themselves properly, type was crisp and clean and dried quickly. The easy peel worked as advertised and the labels looked great on the day's outgoing mail of all types.I've since run some special labels with color print and graphics and was impressed by the output. No glitches with multiple sheets either.They do the job and they do it right.  Can't ask for more than that.This is an excellent quality paper, I used it to create photo Christmas cards, and special gift photos. It does a good job!I used these to print signs, and they worked well.  On the back of the paper, it does say EPSON in small letters.  Overall, this was a good product.Believe me paper matters. When you put the wrong paper in your printer, you get very weird results.P.S. This review was before I had used Kodak's One Touch to better Pictures.  Please see my Kodak Paper review prior to making your buying decision.  I was really impressed with what Kodak did.REVIEW IS BASED ON USE ON THE EPSON 890:When I bought my Epson 890, I bought several different packs of Epson paper, this 8 X 10 one, an 8.5 X 11 one and some 4 X 6 sheets as well as the roll paper. See my separate reviews on the others items (including the printer) also on this site, if you are interested in them. However, finally, I got around to trying the 8 x 10 paper. You see you wait until you have the perfect picture to do an enlargement.NICE QUALITY IN SEVERAL DIFFERENT USESIt did not dissappoint. Wow, the colors were great. I took several types of pictures and different lighting and the result were great. Now that I've tried it I'm hooked. People who have seen the pictures first of all can't believe they are off an inkjet printer. Then they marvel at the color and sharpness of the photo.PAPER AND PRINTER INTERATION:One caution, those of you that think you can use any paper on any printer... Forget it. I had some paper from another supplier and when I used it on the Epson, the ghostly images were terrible. It seems not surprisingly that the printers are optimized for their papers. And to be honest, it is not worth the money to me to try a bunch of other manufacturer's paper only to find out the results would be bad.EASIER TO FIND ON THE WEB THAN IN THE STORES:This paper is easier to find on the net. I have looked in my usual spots for this paper off the web and considering not only computer, office supply and grocery stores it is just not out there.Great product... Enjoy.I bought this to print 4x6's in my pixma. These are really nice quality for the price. I found them to be just as nice as higher end 4x6 paper. It prints great on an inkjet. I recommend this product. Any questions please ask i am always looking for advice so i enjoy giving it when i can as well.Nice product,produces very good pics.Nice heavy paper thats works well in my Canon printer.Should last a long time !!! GreatThe Epson High-Gloss Premium Photo Paper is very high quality inkjet paper that produces fantastic looking, smudge resistant prints from myEpson Stylus Photo 2200 Inkjet Printer.This paper is very quick drying so prints can be stacked without worrying that they will stick together. I also like that it is fairly heavy stock so prints have the feel of professional lab quality.Highly Recommended!CFHI knew this was a good price and the quality of the paper was excellent. I ordered it because I had previously ordered the Epson printer. Product was received within a few days.We've been using HP inkjet printers for years and we have a pretty good stash of 4x6 photo paper that we had planned to use with our new Epson Artisan 710 printer.  Unfortunately, when we printed our first 4x6 photo we knew immediately that something was wrong since the colors were extremely blotchy and it took the ink several minutes to dry.I tried changing every printer and quality setting I could find, then it occurred to me that the problem might be the HP paper.  I was skeptical, but I figured I would buy a pack of this paper just to test the theory since it is fairly inexpensive.Anyway, I know it sounds crazy, but this paper completely solved the problem and we're getting beautiful prints from our new Epson Artisan 710 printer!  If you're planning on using HP photo paper with an Epson printer; take my advice and give it away instead - then buy some of this Epson paper for awesome results!As far as the quality of the paper goes, it feels just like the paper used by professional labs.  It also has the right level of gloss to print photos that are sharp and colorful.I highly recommend this paper for use with Epson printers.Recently I got a newEpson XP-410  Printerand was extremely dissatisfied with the quality of the photo prints. After complaining about it to a friend, he told me to try using Epson's own photo paper (I had used HP paper before). Sure enough, the quality of prints improved dramatically. Since my Epson printer is WiFi AND AirPort compatible, I'd much rather use it than my old HP printer. Which means that from now on I'll be shopping for Epson photo paper as well, and my stockpile of old HP paper has become useless. I may still hang on to it just in case I switch back to an HP printer at some point in the future.The paper itself is very nice. The prints are smooth and glossy, as advertised. They are on par with the prints you'll get from the numerous online photo printing sites, but the exact outcome may depend on the quality of the printer you have, as well as on the ink. I am also not sure how durable these prints are, but since I still have many digital photos gracing the walls of my house that are over a decade old, I am pretty confident that this paper will endure for a foreseeable future.This photo paper was quite cheap price wise but works great in my Lexmark, HP, and Epson printers with no problem at all. The quality is decent enough for me and at this price it's super cheap. Performs well, seems to work in a variety of printers, and very inexpensive, I would recommend this for the casual user wanting a few frame picture of the kids etc.We have an Epson R1900 Photo printer. We use Epson photo paper in it exclusively. This paper is high quality and produces very true colors and sharpness. When we buy it at Amazon it is less expensive than when on sale at Epson.I usually used Kodak paper, but I ordered this largely on comments about it being instant dry and very durable.  Both comments are true.  This stuff is ready to use as soon as it comes out of the printer and it can handle small mounts of moisture for several seconds without running or smudging.  I'll never use Kodak again.I bought this photo paper when I was in search of some more photo paper to print out my pictures at home and after looking around I came upon this photo paper from Epson. I had actually recently bought an Epson Workforce 845, so I decide to try the Epson paper as well. In simple words, this is very high quality paper that I would recommend for your 4x6 printing at home. It obviously isn't going to be the &#34;best&#34; , but for the price you definitely can't go wrong. I will be purchasing more of this photo paper in the future as it nice photo paper.This brand of photo paper is truly premium. I print a lot of photos. This is one of the best quality photo papers I've come across. The photos come out looking like you just picked them up from a photo printing store.I started using this paper in 2005, and I'm still using it. I occasionally print sizes up to 8"x10", but about 90% of my color photo printing is on the 4"x6" paper. I've probably used close to a thousand sheets, and the paper quality has been consistently excellent. I'm currently using the paper with an Epson XP-850 printer. I've tried using other brands, but forget it, they never give the rich, vivid color prints that the Epson paper gives.We bought a dedicated photo printer for our preschool.  Epson XP-600.  It was smallish and held photo paper in its trays.  It took us a while to dial in on the right paper for the Airprint from our iOS devices.  This Premium paper did the trick.  Ultra Premium was too shiny and did not look right.  Kodak and HP paper did not work at all.  Neither did the cheaper stuff.  When the price is right here on Amazon, stock up!!!A word on photo quality. Using a Epson Artisan printer with the correct paper will produce better photos than you will get at a typical photo lab. I highly recommend the Epson Photo papers as they are designed for the Epson inks and the Epson printers specifically. I tested the "Epson Premium Photo Paper Glossy" and "Epson Ultra Premium Photo Paper Glossy" and recommend both. Looking at the same image side by side on the two papers the differences are almost imperceptible. The detail and color are identical under the most careful scrutiny. A few differences emerge under very careful observation:* The Ultra Premium Paper is slightly heavier paper, this adds to its stiffness. When picking up a 4x6" photo from the 4" edge there is about half as much bend vs the Premium Paper.* The Ultra Premium Paper has an ISO brightness of 96, versus 92 for the Premium Paper. This makes no difference in color rich areas of photos but in light highlights if you stare long enough you can convince yourself they are brighter in the Ultra Premium. Telling the difference in brightness requires good light, identical photos side by side, and far too much scrutiny.* The Premium costs about 12.7 cents per 4x6 sheet in packs of 100* The Ultra Premium costs about 22.7 cents per 4x6 sheet in packs of 100Given the quality differences are almost imperceptible and the price difference is almost double I'd recommend the Premium for every day use and the Ultra Premium only if you are entering a photo contest or have money burning a hole in your pocket. Photos on the Premium paper will be better than you'd get at your local Walgreens or Costco.Epson Ultra Premium Photo Paper Glossy, 4 x 6, 100 Sheets (S042174)I was shopping for 4x6 photo paper for my Epson printer.  The Epson Premium Paper was a good choice.  Price is right and the quality is fine.I've been a user of Epson glossy photo papers for over a decade.  I've never had a problem with them.  Colors are brilliant and don't fade.  Granted, some of that is ink performance, but the paper clearly lets the ink succeed!  If you have an Epson printer and are using Epson ink, look no further!This was literally the only paper I could find in this size !!!Luckily is does a decent job. Fills a nice niche as 11x14.worried they wont produce it much longer though.I have used several different Epson photo papers.  I prefer the ultrapremium and premium luster papers, especially when you are showing your prints or framing them.  Otherwise, the premium gloss paper is an excellent buy.This is just the size of paper I was looking for. The price was much better than I could find locally.We take so many pictures and have an amazing picture printer, but in the end the paper is an important part in capturing that image just right.  Epson photo paper leaves images clear and bright as well as smudge free.  Overall a great photo paper and the price is great!This color print paper works great on my Epson Stylus color printer. The only caveat I have is don't lay the paper down on the clear plastic envelope that holds the paper as there is a sticky strip on the clear plastic that will ruin any paper it touches.  Also do not leave the print paper out in the light keep it in the dark and in the box until you are ready to use it.  Great stuff!  Is not terribly expensive either.This paper works well with the Epson printer but I would not expect any less from Epson. I would like to see more than 20 sheetsI purchased this paper because it was the cheapest brand out there- and printing your own photos is an expensive hobby. I had intended to use Epson papers for trial runs or copies for friends.  However, the quality of my photos was incredible using epson paper.  The colors are much more vivid and they don't fade over time as some photo papers do.  I now use Epson paper for all my 4x6 photos and I save money!prints are sharp with great color saturation. what more can you ask for from photo paper?You get what you pay for, Though I bought an off brand one last year for the same price which was much better. This one is very stiff and the edges get loose string. This is just a piece of mat cut to shape. Nothing special but gets the job done.This is a simple little mouse pad but works well.  My only objection was that I ordered it along with a new keyboard, expecting them to be shipped together.  The mouse pad, which cost around $3.00, was shipped separately and $5.00 freight was added, which did not make this purchase cost-effective.  Other than that, I have no complaints about the pad itself.For me, I find this Belkin Standard Mouse Pad perfect for my home office. It looks great next to my desktop computer and works very well with my cordless mouse.In fact, I like this mouse pad so much, I purchased one that I keep in my laptop's bag for on the go travel.This is a great quality mouse pad. In fact, I think that is a Best Buy!Highly recommend this one!It does the job, it has given me good use, but what all can one say about a mouse pad?It's cheap and it works, so there isn't a lot I can say about it.  It's a bit thinner than some I've had, but it serves the purpose for which it was designed and purchased.It has a good size.  It has a good surface to track on.  It is very, very lightweight though.  But it stays down just fine over time.Great product for the price. Pretty standard mouse pad nothing extraordinary about it other than the price. It works for what it was meant to work for.Pros:  Smooth surface for the mouse to glide on.  Visually appealing.  Inexpensive.Cons: No grip on the bottom, so it does occasionally move when my kids are playing with it, but it slides back in place just as easily.Overall, We've had this a few months and I'm happy with this purchase.  I'd  recommend it if you're looking for a basic mouse pad to replace a cracked or outdated one.Not as nice as I expected, but I was tired of having my mouse directly on my desk. This solved the problem, but don't expect anything  fancy. Rather than the cloth/rubber I expected, it seemed to be made out of cheap foam. Some free mouse pads may be better than this one, but it is certainly better than nothing.These belkin mouse pads are cheap and effective.  They are worth your consideration when you need a small pad for your mouse.These should all be .89 cents regardless of color but it changes often. Just dont get them wet or the glue will come loose and the fabric will fall off. Not worth more than .89 cents so get any color that is cheaper.Yeah, it's a mouse pad, but the top surface is poorly attached and curled up very quickly.  Better to have one that's all one piece.This is a simple, yet needed item, so I was thrilled to find such a good price. If you use a computer, eventually you go through these as they get dirty or frayed around the edges..This review is of the AT&T; Trimline model 210, made by Advanced American Telephone under license from AT&T.;  Along with similarly-shaped "Trimstyle" and other imitator models, there are readily available  two other, similar phones entitled to use the term "Trimline":  one marketed by Northwestern Bell (which sells a  lot of corded phones); the other the model 205 Trimline, as one expects a bit simpler than the model at hand.  The model  210 Trimline has a long history of production at different sites, with few pauses from the mid-1960s to the present.  During the early days of renting the phone from Ma Bell they were made in Indiana  (rotary models, too); then (according to Wikipedia) tone models came out of Singapore, the Philippines, Mexico, China and again China.  I think the advantages definitely outweigh the disadvantages of owning a newly made model 210, and I'll elaborate:PROS:  Fully modular:  not only the handset but the line cord is modular, including lead into the telephone base itself (prior reviewers did not find that feature) .  This makes extending the line cord a breeze, substituting  either a very long male/male phone cord, or inserting a modular (F/F) adapter in the middle of two conjoined male/male cords.  I've tried that and found fit-and-finish were fine with GE brand coupler from the "Also bought" recommendations at this site.A little heavier than some previous "retro" Trimlines, but of course not nearly so heavy as the originals of the Sixties and Seventies;Receiver volume can be raised or lowered via  switch on the outside of the handset;Inside the phone below the number pad are found an OFF-LO-HI  volume switch (note that it is possible to turn the ringer off entirely, although some earlier reviews have said the contrary).  Chirper is a moderate, office-style pitch, nothing extraordinary;Can hold (if the specs are right) up to 13 stored numbers, although that may really mean ten stored numbers plus the three feature buttons for Fire, Police and Ambulance;It can indeed mount on a wall--just follow instructions.Small footprint and an acknowledged "classic" design, down to the rounded rectangular buttons on the handset.  Lack of ringer bell notwithstanding, this is probably the Trimline design and touchpad layout that best mimics the Bell (Western Electric) Trimlines of 40 years ago.Switchable Tone/Pulse on handset should anyone still need to imitate rotary-dial "pulls" with Pulse;Surprisingly cheap.  This model retails at thirty-two .95 (and you can expect to see it a great deal cheaper here)  Accessories are cheap, but color issues may arise (see below)..CONS:  No one really knows how long this particulate incarnation is going to last under ordinary residential use..  Some prior reviewers had their Trimlines fail almost immediately; others have kept this same model no. for ten years and more;Handset has buttons for "Flash", "Redial" and "Mem[ory]," but not a dedicated "Hold" button per se;This is not a two-line phone; even the cheapest of them cost more;The "lit" handset is indeed so dimly lit as to be practically useless.  At least no separate AC connection is required.There is nothing remotely domestic (USA/Can) about 210's current manufacturing site, China;The coiled handset cord provided is short (a loop of about 32 inches stretched but not overstressed; i.e. about 1.4 feet per side); and . . .Finding  a new longer coiled handset cord, while easy as to function with so many suppliers around, has proved to be a real BEAR when it comes to matching colors!  This AT&T; white is more of an off-white, not the Polar white of GE/RCA white phone accessories, nor anyone else's ivory, ash, or beige that I can determine.  Technically "off-white" as a color still exists in the canon of AT&T; accessories, but.... please let me know if you find any.And speaking of which, despite a need, product instructions lack any attempt to sell accessories like phone cords by mail or web.SUMMARY:  If you want a corded phone with a small footprint for light use that weighs a little more than was strictly necessary,  the current 210 should serve.  But if you want only one "main" corded phone for the living room, kitchen or office, there are plenty more choices out there.  For about twice the money you can get a speakerphone white model out of Northwestern Bell and other Bell competitors and survivors; with not only speakerphone but  more memory, usually a dedicated `Hold' button . . .  and at the higher price ranges genuine TWO-line phones make their appearance!  (This may beg the question of why a second corded line is needed, but there are home/office situations where that's for the best.)Whether your backup is a rarely used cell phone prone to battery depletion, or a traditional corded phone like the Trimline 210, test it every now and then.  No one wants to come across failure during a real emergency situation.Along with its Brady Bunch-era  charm, the Trimline 210 is a recognized design classic.  If you find it a little too bland and you want to make a stronger nostalgia statement, repro-retro Princess phones are not hard to find.  To buy American, some residential phones out of Cortelco that were  manufactured in the USA can still be found.  Good luck whatever your decision, and if any of you know how to find accessories (peripherals) like an AT&T; coiled handset cord in their signature off-white version of white, kindly "Comment" here to that effect!  Thanks.Great classic design.  I imagine it is a wonderful phone if you get one that works.  Mine refused to ring, and yes I checked the ring setting.  Returned it.This model has all the features most people would want on a landline type phone, and mfg. by AT&T, I am expecting a long-lasting lifespan on this device. I wall-mounted mine (easily) and it has been operating perfectly!finally a phone that you don't need to plug into an electrical outlet, no power supply needed, just a phone jack.It's just right, for $12, it's a steal.What you have here is a quality, reliable phone.  While it's not like the updated models you see today, it serves its purpose, and serves its purpose quite well.  When it comes down to it, no matter what kind of fancy phone you see in the world today, you're still basically typing numbers in *just* to talk to someone.  This is why ANY phone will do.  The size, comfort and everything else doesn't matter when it comes down to it.  Don't even get me started on "ring tones".  Geez.As long as the numbers work and the signal is clear, who cares?  The AT&T; phone is exactly what you should buy.  It's a good old phone.Best corded phone on the market -- voice quality, lighted keypad, small footprint. It's everything I need.Perfect replacement  at reasonable cost for an old phone I had.You can't beat this phone for quality and value from AT &T & Amazon.This phone started to have problems around the 1yr mark. First, a lot of static and now it just keeps disconnecting calls. Looking for another.The AT&T; Trimeline is a very basic corded phone that works when the power goes out. We bought three of these (one for our house, shop, and my mother's house) to use mostly as backup for when our various cordless phones become unusable in during power outages (more frequent than I like in our area).We have these connected to line splitters (likeBelkin RJ11 Plug/2-RJ11 Jack Modular T Adapter) and they work just fine. These also have physical switches to adjust the ringer volume and phone volume which, although limited, does give us some control. It is also handy that the keypad is "backlit" and draws power directly from the phone line, allowing you to see the numbers in the dark.While these phones do have the ability to store numbers and even speed-dial, we have not set them up to do it.Highly Recommended!CFHthis is a no frills corded phone.It works out of the box and the sound quality is sufficient- not special.for 10 bucks you can't expect too much but it met all my expectationsI lose electricity now and then and need to have a corded phone...my other one died..lol...THIS one is a great slim size AND the price is ridiculously low! It's a keeper!Big numbers, NO batteries needed, just plug it in the telephone jack and you're ready for flawless calls!  Buy one now!Excellent simple old fashioned wired phone. I hate portable phones because their sound quality is never as good as wired. I mounted this on the bathroom wall. Good quality for the low price.A corded land line with a lighted dial, good sound quality, and the ability to have 'saved' numbers for easy redialing.We needed a corded phone to use during winter power outages here in rural northern Vermont.  I tried a couple of the cheapo Radio Shack specials and they were absolutely unsatisfactory with small cramped buttons, unlit keypads, and poor volume.  I went through the reviews and settled on this AT&T; handset and it's worked out very, very well.PROS:- The handset is sizeable and you can actually get a decent grip on it.- The ear receiver is larger than other handsets and actually fits right on the ear. This doesn't sound like much, but it makes a difference in a noisy atmosphere.- The buttons are good sized and light well enough to see in dim lighting.- The volume is adjustable and even though I am slightly hard of hearing, it is more than adequate without turning it all the way up.- The price! The price! The price!  It's a bargain!CONS:- The base is light for a desk-top type phone. Got to be careful when you yank it around - it will fly off the counter. (Alternately, it does mount on the wall.)- The handset cord is too short. I read this in the other reviews so I did order a 12-foot stretchable replacement handset cord with the phone and I'm glad I did.  If you buy this phone, you should too.All in all, it's a very, very good phone.  Good quality at a great price.This is a very nice phone for the price and I have no complaints. Good sound quality and easy to handle and use.You learn that when there is a power outage, the cordless will not work because the base is plugged into the electrical socket so its a good little phone to have plugged into a landline that's there when you need it, even if you have a cell phone ....because you could have a low battery and this landline though to some out dated, it sure helps in a pinch.!I've been using the Trimline phone since it was called the Princess Phone back in the Ma Bell days. Except back then, they were more expensive. My old ones were getting staticy, so they were overdue for replacement. I threw them out and bought two of these. This thing is ten bucks, and it works great. I have a white one and a black one so that I will have a little variety and political correctness in my home.Great price on the phone, but quality of sound is not good. It still can be used if you main phone broke and you need temporarily to use something else until you purchase a better phone.I bought this for when the power goes out.  It works great and the price was right for a backup phone.I bought this on Amazon because of the price for my replacement land line.  it is a good phone and it has a good sound to it.  it is not tinny in my ear as some phones are.  Let's face it, it's only a matter of time until the land line phone is history along with the phone book so I wasn't spending a lot of money on it.  The ringer is nice and not annoying as some are.  I am happy with my purchase.This is a good basic corded telephone.  I lost my electricity this morning and of the four telephones I have, this was the only one that worked during the outage, even though my other telephones have battery back ups.I recommend this telephone for someone who is not concerned about frills.August 2012. I purchased two of these phones to wall mount in my basement and garage. They work - meaning they ring - but I get complaints about voice quality on every call. Cost was $9.00 each with free shipping (assuming the order totaled at least $25.00)Despite some remarks that these phones can not be wall mounted, those statements are simply NOT true. I have two of these phones, both of which are currently wall mounted. As noted in the instructions, you must reverse a clip on the base unit for wall mounting. That clip then provides a tab/hook that keeps the phone firmly in place on the base unit. This type of arrangement is essentially universal to all phones that I've ever seen that can be both used horizontally or vertically. To switch the tab from horizontal to vertical mounting took less than 5 seconds.Another bit of confusion. A few reviewers state that the cord from the base to phone is hard wired and can not be replaced with a longer one. That is not true, at least in 2012. The cord has standard clips on both ends and can be replaced at will.Yet despite that mis-information - I'm VERY disappointed with the voice quality. Every time I answer these phones people complain (unsolicited) about the voice quality. A hard wired phone (as opposed to a cordless) should sound great but clearly these phones don't! Your only real option for a better hard wired phone would be a Panasonic, at about $30.00.If you're looking for a very basic phone that is of high quality and durability, this is the phone for you! It met my expectations in every way. Of course I like that the AT&T name stands behind it. I have always known them to produce quality products and stand by their products if there happened to be any problem. As I said though, this phone is the basic... no caller ID, etc., no bells and whistles... just a phone with great sound clarity that seems like it will last me as long as I need to use it. I'm very satisfied with my purchase. The phone itself even looks nice. I got it in white... shows the dust less! Ringer volume is perfect and adjustable, as is the voice volume. There are also three one-touch speed-dials for emergency numbers or that special someone you want to keep reachable at your fingertips! I would highly recommend this phone to anyone who needs a basic communication device and who still believes in the AT&T name. You can't go wrong purchasing from Amazon at this price either... it's really remarkable all you get for such an inexpensive phone! Best wishes talking on your new AT&T phone!I've loved the trimline phone ever since I got my first phone more than 20 years ago.  Then, the trimline was a real, Bell System, telephone.  Although this phone is clearly not the same as the real Bell trimline phones, it still has the great, comfortable design and the dialpad in the handset, which makes it an excellent choice.  I've compared several other trimline phones and this is the closest phone I could find to the original Bell phones.Northwestern Bell also makes a trimline phone, but the quality and comfort are nowhere near this AT&T; version.If you read the other reviews, you will see that at least one review (dated November of 2004) says that this phone was discontinued.  Yet, here we are in late November 2004, and its still around.  I'm guessing (could be wrong here) that this phone will be around forever, even though AT&T; no longer promotes it on their web-site.I recently bought this phone after several two more expensive models failed; his telephone by AT&T; and Lucent works better than the other phones I bought when I had to get a new phone for my home. The construction of this telephone reflects great engineering; and it's very, very reliable for a price that's very inexpensive these days for a phone. Yes, it is corded; but when all you really need is a basic phone this really does the job. Besides, the fact that this is corded means you'll never misplace the cordless handset!The phone has back lit buttons which are desirable for those of us who are elderly or in any way sight impaired. The buttons could be brighter but the back lighting does improve upon no lighting. The phone offers well known features including "last number redial," too. The phone has a mute feature, adjustable ringer volume and more. These functions never disappoint me. It also has a small knob that lets you switch between touch tone and pulse (rotary) dialing. I use touch tone dialing as most people do. I am particularly impressed that a phone in this price range even has a twelve number memory feature for speed dialing. Cool! However, as another reviewer correctly notes, when you program the phone to remember frequently dialed numbers, you need to actually dial the number--so hang up fast if you don't intend to speak with that person at just that moment! I don't care for that so I will take off one star for this.If you want to take a nap without the phone ringing, just turn the ringer off by using the knob at the base of the phone. That's an incredibly useful feature!I highly recommend this telephone for people who merely want a basic, inexpensive phone that still has a few "frills" to like including memory speed dialing and mute. The extra features give you all you truly need to make this a well constructed telephone at a rather inexpensive price. Sure, the back lighting for the buttons on the phone could be brighter; but overall this is still quite a good phone for the price. The phone takes up little space and it can even be wall mounted to completely save counter space in a kitchen or any other room.We just replaced an older AT&T 210 corded phone with a new one because the sound on the old one had become difficult to hear.  We use the phone as a kitchen wall phone.  The new 210 is lighter than the older one it replaced but seems identical otherwise. This phone is competitively priced and fulfills our needs so we can recommend it without reservation.A classic, well made phone like they all used to be.  Feels good in your hand and sounds good when you listen. Inexpensive but made well.We like to keep one non-electric phone in the house in case power goes out.  We have learned that during hurricanes, earthquakes and even big power failures that sometimes even cell phones don't work but these non-electric phones that plug right into the telephone outlet work when other things don't -that is if your phone service is not from the cable company but driectly from the telephone company. In regular day-today activies we use only cordless and cell phones but they can be useless in an emergency so we like the safety of having one phone like this.  This is fine little phone and the price as great.It's a good basic phone and perfectly worth the price (roughly $10). It's just like you remember from your childhood except in plastic. My only complaint is that the lighted keypad isn't very bright.Does the job and not too flimsy. However, like many lightweight phones, easy to pull off a table when the handset cord gets twisted. If you rely on just your cordless phones, you are making a mistake. During a power failure, you will not be able to use landline service.I use this on one side of a King bed and a cordless on the other.  We have lots of short term outages here, but last week we were out 3+ days after an ice storm. Most landline service will continue to work for a few days during power failures, but you need a hardwired phone at home. This is an inexpensive way to go.I use this phone for a buck up in case the electricity fails and my cordless phones do not work.  I like it much better than similar phones because this phone has a replaceable phone to handset cord.  Most similar phones are hardwired so you cannot replace the cord in case something goes wrong or you want a longer reach cordNo caller id, no bells and whistles.  This is a basic solid well made phone.  Buttons are large and easy to press.  Has 3 speed dials and 10 memory locations.  Last number redial. Tone/pulse switchable.  One drawback -- you CANNOT program a "pause" if you need to dial "9" for an outside line; not a big deal, but you should be aware of that.The phone works very well.  I hear clearly and the people hear me clearly.  The handset is large and that makes it easy to hold.  You can also easily attach a shoulder cushion for holding the phone on your shoulder.  The handset is a tad heavy so I wouldn't use it for hour long calls, but it's perfect for extensions.  And it works in a power failure without batteries.For 10 bucks no one should complain about this phone.The AT&T; Trimline 210 corded phone certainly isn't encumbered with a lot of bells and whistles, but it has enough extras to suit my purpose.We have a 35-year-old home we built. It's a large house with many rooms and the old analog sets were not functioning properly, so I replaced four sets with this trimline model where I can use three one-touch buttons for memory dial and store ten numbers in speed dial. Our cordless sets handle other requirements nicely, but since we're in a cell dead zone and an area with frequent power outages, it's really nice to have an old reliable set. The trimline is just that.Decently made (though sadly not in the USA--no corded telephones are made in the US any more) with just enough extras which include a lighted keypad, a mute button which allows you to hear your caller but prevents them from hearing you, Flash which allows easy access to Call Waiting (if you subscribe to this service) and Redial which redials the last number called.Setup was a snap (two phones installed as wall phones, two as table models) and all phones now have the speed dial numbers stored for quick access. Simple and efficient, and very affordable.If you're looking for a neat, professional look with your giftwrapping, this tape is a big help. It's invisible on the variety of wrapping papers I tried it on. It holds tightly and doesn't curl in on itself. I found it significantly easier to use than regular Scotch tape.This tape does nearly disappear on gift wrap and does hold very securely -- almost too securely; while wrapping Christmas gifts, I realized how dependent I was on being able to carefully peel back a bit of tape and reposition it when necessary.  That can't be done with this tape; once it's stuck, it's stuck.The one thing I didn't like about the tape is that it was somewhat hard to tear off the roll.  This isn't a big deal; it's not like trying to tear, say, adhesive tape, but it often took a couple stabs before the edge of the tape hit the cutter edge just right so the piece of tape would tear off.  This fumbling occasionally caused the tape to reel out too far, or to contact the gift wrap before the tape was torn off the roll (picture holding down gift wrap and tape roll with one hand, pulling tape and tearing with the other), and of course once it encountered the gift wrap, too bad if it wasn't in the right spot.  No peeling it off.If this product and the old standby, Scotch Magic Tape, were available at the same price, I would probably buy this one for gift wrapping since the matte finish and secure sticking were nice on the gifts.  However, if it was priced higher, I'd probably stick with Magic Tape, since it disappears and sticks nearly as well, and it doesn't have the tough-to-tear issues.We ordered this a while ago and have only really used it now that the holidays are in full gear.  This is very impressive tape.  It does exactly what it says it does.  It virtually disappears once you put it on wrapping paper.  After I wrapped some presents for my office party, I asked my two young sons to look for the tape.  They only found it by pressing down on the package and feeling for the tape edge.  Pretty impressive!  In addition to this, it is strong.  As with all scotch tape, once you put it down it really holds paper in place.  Overall, this is a very impressive product that does exactly what it was created to do.  Thus, five stars.What can I say, it's Scotch tape.  I could certainly use the 3 rolls of tape as Christmas is quickly approaching.This is my favorite type of tape.  It looks so "dainty" with the satin finish.  It is perfect for gift wrapping, such as it was intended.But you can use it for whatever you want.It looks so delicate and smooth.With the holidays coming up, this tape is perfect for wrapping.Looks aside, this tape does its job.  It is strong and durable.Highly recommended.Life is too short to wrap gifts with "bargain" tape...Ok, perhaps that is going a bit far, but when I think about all the times I have struggled with tough, bargain brand tape when I am trying to wrap a gift, it makes me wonder what I was thinking.  Sure, if it is what you have at the time, then cheap tape can get the job done.But if you are anything like me, wrapping a gift nicely is enough of a struggle.  Dealing with tape that doesn't want to break when you cut it, tape that won't cut straight, tape that is slightly yellow, well, for me anyhow that is a frustration I am glad to do without during the holidays.  By the time I am done struggling with some off brand roll of tape, it certainly doesn't seem like a "bargain".I would not go so far as to say this tape is invisible, but the satiny finish somehow blends in just perfectly on the wrapping paper to where you almost can't see it.And with 3 rolls, it means no arguing for the tape roll when I am wrapping gifts with the kids.I would say that I was somewhat surprised at how little tape was on each roll. I am not sure if that was because I got it as promotional item,  but as I said having the 3 separate rolls comes in handy, especially if you have kids.Sure, kids will find something else to argue about, and you will find other problems to concern yourself with, but tape doesn't have to be one of them if you use Scotch brand gift tape. As I like to say - quality doesn't really cost, it pays.There's not a lot I can say about Scotch brand tape except that it is of the highest quality.  Whenever I cave in and buy the cheap store brand tape, I always regret it.  Scotch's quality is more than worth the price.This pack of Magic tape includes three rolls of 300 inches.  Though they could have packed a bit more tape on each roll, this is still a good deal and an excellent holiday tool.The satin finish is supposed to make this more invisible than regular "Magic" tape when used on gift wrap.  To my eyes, there is almost no difference.  So the only reason to get this is if the price is better than regular "Magic" tape.  As I write this review, it is!To be clear, there's nothing WRONG with this tape.  It works just as well as regular "Magic" tape.  It's very hard to see when applied.  And, I assume, it'll have the same remarkable durability as regular "Magic" tape.  It's just that it's special feature (satin finish, more invisible on gift wrap) doesn't work.I was skeptical that I would see a difference with this tape compared to regular Scotch tape, so I wrapped two presents: one in regular Scotch tape and one in this Scotch Gift Wrap Tape.The first difference is that the Gift Wrap Tape seems to be slightly more heavy duty. After wrapping, it is also clear that the gift wrap tape was less cloudy and did indeed look better than the present wrapped in regular tape. I wouldn't say that the difference was dramatic, but it was enough.So overall, as long as there is not much of a price difference I would definitely say go with the Gift Wrap Tape in situations where you want whatever you are taping to look nice.I give the tape itself 5 stars -it is fantastic, and is really the best tape to use on wrapping paper, because it does a great job of disappearing.  It is MUCH better, in fact, than the typical Scotch tape which can be removed and reused if not put on correctly --and which is not fully see through.  Though that tape also does a great job when used for wrapping, the Satin Finish tape is better.The only problem I had is that I was really surprised at how little tape came on each of these three rolls; it was ridiculous.  I had a "regular" single roll of Scotch Satin Tape and the tape on THAT roll was at LEAST three times the diameter of the tape on each of these 3-pack rolls.  So, the bottom line is that these three rolls of tape seem to have less tape than a single roll of the regular sized Scotch Satin Tape.  Basically if you like to have more rolls of tape lying around (for example, useful if other people are helping you wrap) AND the three rolls are cheaper, together, than a single roll, then go for the three rolls.  If, however, you like having less clutter, less wasting of resources (more plastic going into the garbage), and NOT running out of tape in the middle of wrapping, go for the single roll.  (The single roll also has the advantage of having a stronger case -and is sealed on both the front and the back.You can't go wrong with the quality of this product, just with the amount of waste, and the amount of tape you get for your money.Recommended as a single roll.  Not recommended as a three pack unless multiple people are wrapping at the same time.The best tape for  gifts - Scotch is the only brand I use.  Pre-cut pieces to make it easier while wrapping a present as it makes it so convenient to use.  I recommend highly!This 3-pack of Scotch tape works really well but the thing is, especially during the holidays with Christmas approaching, you'll go through 3 of these very quickly.  Even when you try to conserve, a situation will probably arise when you'll be using it more than you'd like.  I believe if you have a family of 4 or more, a 3-pack is enough to hold your family over for a few months, however again, this stuff is easily used up like it grows on trees during the Christmas present-wrapping holiday season.  Since it's not very expensive to buy (less than 9 bucks at the moment including shipping and handling) I recommend buying at least two 3-packs (6 packs total).  Hey you never know when that extra pack will come in handy.  Anyway the tape is sticky and reliable enough that I can easily recommend it to anyone and let's be honest, we *all* will unexpectedly need Scotch tape for one reason or another, and it's good to have a pack around when these moments come.You expect tape to do a couple tasks: Adhere and disappear.Scotch does both. 3 rolls ... means more of what tape needs to do.I think this is the best tape for your money and it's the kind I always buy.  It's virtually invisible upon use and it's not too expensive.  I won't use any other tape for gift wrapping.What can you say about great tape? It sticks, it tears easily from the dispenser, and it disappears on the gift wrap, except on foil wrapping were you can still see it a little. I'd get it again for sure.This is a "third generation" Scotch tape.  Like the Scotch tape of old, it has a shiny surface, unlike the second-generation "Magic Tape" Scotch tape which virtually disappears on paper with a conventional "rough" surface.  It's virtually undetectable on shiny gift wrap.  It also has more "body" than the Magic Tape variety, making it easier to use.This Scotch Satin GiftWrap Tape does what tape should do - it's easy to use, sticks to paper effortlessly and is great for wrapping gifts. I found that the satin finish did a nice job disappearing - not like the cheap stuff that has a shiny finish. The price is reasonable too. All in all, this is a great product.Does what it says. You can barely see this tape so any presents you wrap will look flawless. Now I'm going to confess that Scotch makes the best tape for everything. They also make packaging tape that is very easy to use.This tape works great for gifts because it almost disappears after you put it on to give a nice clean look. The quaily of the actual dispenser has gone down hill over the years probably to save costs or the enviornment. It still works ok, but it is sort of flimsy compared to the good old days. But with that small issue aside I still like the tape and plan to continue using it for years to come.3M is probably one of the most innovative companies in the world.  They can take one product and make a thousand slightly different corresponding products from that base product.  They have done that again with the Scotch Gift Wrap Tape.  When you compare it to the standard tape with a non-gloss finish, this tape blends into the packaging material better than the standard.  It gives a nice look that basically hides the tape from a distance.There are two negatives that I noticed:  The tensile strength is slightly higher thus it makes it slightly more difficult to tear.  It also seems to roll up on me with longer strips than the older standard version.  Therefore the 4 stars.. . . and it does what it is supposed to do.  I just went through two rolls wrapping gifts -- and it seems a little more substantial and thicker than cheaper tapes, it isn't the slightest bit shiny, so it disappears on packages, it's easy to tear, the dispenser was sturdy enough that the tape didn't come off the serrated part and stick to itself, and in using the entire two rolls I never had to engage in the frustrating process of trying to find the end and then peel it off of the rest of the roll.  My only beef -- there's not much tape on the rolls.  They're kind of like rolls of wrapping paper, in that it always looks like there's more there than you actually get.It's tape.  It's pretty good tape, and a pleasure to use, but it is just tape.  I would definitely buy Scotch gift wrap tape again, though I don't expect it to change my life.I have 5 November birthdays and each of them got a few presents.  This Scotch tape is perfect.  It tears off nicely and when you put it on your packages, you can't even notice it's there.  Scotch is the only brand I ever got but they improved the quality of this tape by making it invisible.Also, the price on Amazon is great.  I highly recommend it if you are fussy with your packages like I am.Scotch Giftwrap Tape may not be new, but if you've never tried it, now's the time! It is made with a special satin or semi-gloss finish that makes the tape virtually invisible on most giftwrap paper. Try it on a package and you'll be surprised at how it disappears. Scrapbookers might want to experiment with this tape as well. With all of the holiday gift wrapping near, you really need to get some of this tape - you will be rewarded with praise for your professional looking packages. Very highly recommended!I probably wouldn't use this tape for gift wrapping after realizing -like many of the other reviewers- that there is not a whole lot of tape on each roll.  I'm not so concerned that my gifts look impeccabl, so I wouldn't pay more for this product for that use.  BUT, I had some beloved children's books that my kids have been rough on and pulled out the tape today to see how it faired compared to the regular tape that I normally use to tape up little tears and bends and this stuff is AWESOME!  It feels much thicker and more durable than regular tape and is nearly impossible to see. I pulled out one book that has lots of bad bends, some tears, and the binding is wearing off.  I taped every single little thing to see how it would look afterwards and to see how durable it felt.  I was completely impressed!  I seriously couldn't see where I had taped and it felt really strong. And the book looked and felt 100 times better than the books that I used regular tape on. It is also important to note that the tape feels really silky and soft and it it difficult to feel where the edges are.  I'm not sure how they did that, but I love it!  I will DEFINITELY keep some rolls on hand for book repairs because I think it would be worth the slightly additional cost for the vast improvement in look and durability.After trying cheaper brands of tape, I always return to Scotch tape because of the quality. This is no different. Does what it is marketed for, not showing up on gift wrap. Like that it disappears because the package does look nicer without seeing the tape. Would like to see if it comes in 1/2 inch size. I find the 3/4 inch too wide.While the glossy tape that I use at the office is good for keeping things together, it shows up very easily on gift wrap, being all shiny.  The matte or satin finsh on this is perfect for gifts..  doesnt attract or reflect light, so that you see the wrapping paper and not the tape. Very simple and it works.Con:  this type of tape is really for gift wrapping and isnt as attractive for normal everyday use, but it can be used as such.  Get both scotch gift tape and scotch regualr tape and you will have the right tape for the right occasion.Ever since I was a little kid I have loved this Scotch glossy tape.  It's the only brand and variety of tape that I will buy.  It's a little unfortunate that they market this as "gift wrap tape" because while it is ideal for gift wrap (it literally disappears), it's also perfect for any other task requiring tape. On some surfaces the glossy-ness of the tape will stick out, I still prefer that glossy-ness to the dull-ness that you get by using regular tape.  I also find this stuff to be stickier and easier to work with (long pieces) than the regular Scotch 'matte' tape. Note that Amazon probably isn't your best bet for buying the stuff, as I often see it cheaper at local stores.Maybe I'm taking advantage of the vine here, but this comes just in time for the holiday wrapping season.  I like the strips I reviewed ealier, but these are just as good when I'm in the thick of the package wrapping experience.  They are right, I can step back a few feet and I cannot see the tape on the paper when it turns invisible on contact.  The 3/4 inch size is just right for packages, the half inch stuff is too skinny and too easy to tangle when pulling loner strands off the rolls.Tape like this can be taken for granted unless you have some of the old dimestore stuff around and try and use it.  Hard to get off the roll, breaks easy, gets yellow all problems not happening with this cheap stuff.  Why doesn't it get five stars, well one can say this is a five star product, but they've not done much inovation in the last several years.  Can they inovate, I don't know, maybe it's too perfect now, but sooner or later everything gets better, and I challenge 3M to improve this.This is great tape for wrapping presents, it truly does become almost invisible when applied to the wrapping paper.  It's easy to use, tears easily, and I love that it's a 3 pack.  Maybe nothing in the world is more frustrating than running out of tape mid package!I highly recommend this tape!This stuff is fantastic.  If you love wrapping packages that have that "Ooh, how did you do that without the tape showing" look, be SURE to grab this stuff!  Been buying it for years and have used it as a professional wrapping staple since it was introduced.  Lasts forever, is a great 3/4" wide so it covers those larger package ends. Great quality, MADE IN THE USA!, highly, highly recommend!I wrap a lot of gifts at the holiday season.  I am more into wrapping with wrapping patterned paper than the expensive option of gift bags.  So I tend to be very picky when it comes to my paper and tape.  I love this tape, I've been buying it for a few years.  It is actually a little bit more shiny than the regular Scotch tape, but blends into wrapping paper better than regular Scotch tape.  I used to use the double stick tape, but that was getting too expensive, especially with the kids just ripping off the paper quicker than you can say "boo".  I am the one who cares so much about how the finished gift wrapping looks, yes I admit that.  But when giving a gift to someone other than my own family, looks do mean a lot.  I spent a lot of time deciding what to give this person, so when I wrap it, I want it to look like I care.  So I use this tape.I like to think that fingerprints don't seem to show as easily as regular Scotch tape, but that may just be wishful thinking.  It seems that with this Gift Wrap tape, the actual adhesive on the film is more microscopic so you can't see the texture like you do with regular Scotch tape.As far as the 3 roll thing, I much prefer to buy a regular roll and put it into a dispenser.  The flimsy dispenser that the rolls come in in the 3 roll pack are very basic.  The length of tape you get with the 3 roll pack is a lot shorter than a single roll, so if you have many gifts to wrap, then consider buying more of the single rolls.  Another reason you might like the single roll is because the serrated edge for the tape cutter is much more crude than a heavy desktop tape dispenser or even a regular plastic dispenser.  I prefer the weight of the desktop tape dispenser when wrapping a lot of gifts.  Its a bit easier to tear off the tape with that weight in it, and it's more of a one handed job than a two handed job.We've only ever use Scotch tape at my house, it's the tape that holds up better in not ripping or tearing when you don't want it to. It's always been stronger in keeping this together than the cheaper brands. The Gift Wrap tape is excellent for wrapping any gifts as it boasts a certain amount invisibility. It doesn't completely disappear, of course, but it's less noticeable than other kinds of tape. The price for three roles is pretty cheap as well. I would definitely recommend this Scotch Gift Wrap for any holiday or birthday wrapping you need.What, exactly, can you say about Scotch Tape...? It was intended for gift-wrapping, and it does it's job nicely. My Wife is a fanatical wrapper, and hates when you can see the tape on the wrapped presents, and the Scotch Gift Wrap Tape passed her highly critical eye with flying colorsThanks for making my Holiday season a little bit easier, Scotch.  ;)I normally just use regular tape to seal wrapping paper and thought it looked fine.  Well, after using this gift wrapping finish tape, I don't think I will be going back to standard tape.  The wrapping paper no longer shows the tape as easily and it just looks more "professionally" wrapped.  It just makes the gift look more pleasing.  It's amazing what a visual difference it makes.I highly recommend this product.I love this tape for gift wrapping because you almost can't tell the tape is there, unlike the green version. It does the job and blends in with the wrapping beautifully.I finally had a chance to try this product while undergoing a Christmas present wrapping marathon.I used three types of tape: Scotch Gift Wrap tape, Scotch Magic tape, an off brand matte tape and an off brand glossy/shiny tape.I also wrapped using tissue paper, glossy wrapping paper, and dollar store wrapping paper.The Scotch Gift Wrape tape outperformed the other three on all areas.  THe most noticable being when I used tissue paper. The tape was completely invisible.  Even the Magic tape showed up.There was a huge difference in the ease of the tape.  The Gift Wrap tape was silky and smooth and went easily from dispenser to paper. It didn't pick up any dust or anything else in transit. I was wrapping on a carpeted basement floor with a dog nearby. The off brands actaully picked up dog hair and dust on the way from the dispenser to the wrapping paper.Overall, there is no comparison between the Scotch Gift Wrap tape and the others.  It is worth the price (and I'm saying this as a cheapskate) because less is wasted due to the quality.I would buy this regularly in the future and I would recommend this to all.You can NOT go wrong with scotch tape. It's a classic. This definitely came in handy on Black Friday when I sat down after shopping and wrapped all my gifts. My fiance was so outdone when he came home and saw gifts already wrapped! :) lolI have routinely spent a lot of money on nice, colorful gift wrap and then, when I get the gift wrapped all that seems to stand out is the tape that is used to seal the package.  This gift wrap tape actually becomes invisable on the package and lets your gift wrap show through.  It doesn't cost much more to make your gift wrapping look really professional.  I used this tape on both a solid blue colored wrap and a mulit-colored paper and it worked great on both.  It was also invisable where I used the tape to attach the little envelope with the gift tag and note,  I recommend this tape and will probably end up using it for more than just gift wrapping.. it's a very nice tape for everyday use as well.I guess you might say tape is tape is tape but there are varying qualities from the cheap generic to the more expensive name brands like Scotch.  Right here around the Holiday Season gift wrapping is certainly something we're doing a lot of so a set of three rolls of tape comes in very handy.  This particular tape sticks on flat and clear so as not to obscure your wrapping paper.  A definitive advantage over the cheaper tape is that the adhesive is very strong - this tape is not going to pop off the paper as you work on a complex wrap job.  Once it is in place it stays.  I like that.  It pulls from the roll and tears off well on the cutting teeth.  Overall it is good quality tape.We use Scotch Gift wrap tape for all our wrapping of presents.  It is a superior product in every way.Most commercial gift wrap has a sheen as we all know.  We, a long time ago, used regular Scotch tape, the one in the red roller that we all grew up with.  It was always very visable because of the shine on the tape.  Mending a torn page in a book would always be very obvious and after time it would yellow a bit.  Then came the green lable---major improvment.  It had a non-gloss surface that really works well for mending torn book pages etc.  However it was still noticable on gift wrap as the paper had more sheen than the tape----and now, we have a solution to this heart wrenching problem.  Seriously, Scotch GiftWrap is a noticable improvment, it is as close to invisable as one could get as the sheen is about the same as the paper!  You get the tape stuck in the wrong place and try to remove it, you have a mess.  With this product, you just can't spot the goof up! (If you every saw my gift-wrap ability, you would understand why I like it so much). It really is a good quality product and does what it claims so I think the four stars are earned!I'm not real sure what I'm supposed to say about this stuff in a review. I mean, is there anybody in the United States who isn't familiar with Scotch tape? It's the grand daddy of all cellophane tapes, and this gift wrap tape just adds a couple features that make Scotch tape better and better. First, it's a handy three pack, just in time for Christmas and assuring even the biggest of gift givers enough tape to wrap everything. Then, there's the satin finish, which becomes darn near invisible on patterned paper, and pretty close to that on everything else. Finally, it sticks. This is a great product, and I don't see how I couldn't give it five stars.Works great - Easy tear - Can not notice it on Christmas packages - Comfortable dispenser and highly affordable! What more can ya want in tape??Sure, regular clear tape works fine for gift-wrapping, but if you want your gifts to look like they're professionally wrapped with a tape that blends into the wrapping paper so well you almost don't know it's there, this is the tape for you. The best thing about this tape is that you virtually don't see it on most gift wrapping paper. The satin finish isn't too shiny or mattte. It holds very well and the three pack is a convenient size. Now that I've used this tape, I just can't go back to the old tape I used to use.A quick tip: If you press down and smooth the tape with your fingers after it's on the gift, the tape blends in with the wrapping paper even more and looks like it almost disappears.Great product!Scotch continues their tradition of top quality products withScotch Gift Wrap Tape, 3/4 inch, 3 rolls. With its semigloss (or satin as they call it) finish, the tape looks very nice on gifts and it's hardly noticeable. While it might not actually disappear on the paper, I doubt many people pay much attention to the tape when they're busy tearing open gifts. The tape adheres well and does everything you could rationally ask of it. However, my one problem is the amount of tape on the dispenser, which is rather measly in comparison to a regular roll of Scotch tape. I'd rather get more tape, even if it means paying more, so that there is a reasonable amount on the roll, and there would be far less waste. Altogether, the tape is nice and the price seems fair.We've long been fans of Scotch brand products - always finding them dependable.  The same is true of this Scotch Gift Wrap Tape.  It's that time of year again and we've made good use of this already.  It holds wrapping securely yet is transparent enough not to spoil the colorful paper.We also  use it to cover addresses on parcels to be  mailed, knowing it will protect the ink even if the packages are caught in a wet blizzard.The holidays aren't the only  times this tape  comes in handy as we've used it to repair torn pages in a notebook, by doubling it we've used it to attach To-From cards and, believe it or  not, in a real hurry it held the torn hem of a skirt.You  never know what it might be used  for  next - only that you'd better have some on hand.I've never had an issue with the way normal tape looks when wrapping presents, but this tape does really disappear and it looks good.  You can still see the tape of course but it's much less visible than normal tape.If you wrap a lot of presents or are a Martha Stewart-type perfectionist, you might want to consider this tape.  The other 99% of us can just use normal tape! :)The tape - at first I wondered: "How can this be different?". The answer is rather subtle ... the tape has a strong backing with a semi-gloss (satin if you will) finish. For a "tape collector" I guess it is slightly between "magic" and clear tape.* Not a big deal to me and most people, but hey different strokes for different folks.Also it is considered "photo safe" I guess that means it won't yellow over time like tape from the 70s does/has.This is by far my favorite type of tape to use for gift wrapping. The tape breaks off of the roll easily, and does not bend or warp. The tape always sticks well, holds tight and remains clear. A very attractive option for gift wrapping.Now this is what I needed. Very clear and at a great deal. Its hard to see the tape on the gifts I had to wrap. Tried some cheaper tape. What a mistake. For now on I am going to use this.This tape is perfect for wrapping all of your presents.  It completely dissapears into the paper and makes your gifts look flawless. It has a strong hold and you don't need to use a lot of it in order to make the paper stay.Sounds like a miniscule item to be concerned about, but this is great tape.  It makes your packages look so much better and is a dream to use. Doesn't get stuck where you don't want it and virtually disappears on paper.I hate wrapping gifts, so I really liked how easy the tape made it.  You couldn't see the fingerprints, it has a nice finish to it, and the pieces are precut to a nice short length.  I found this all very helpful.  I read on one of the reviews that there was a complaint about the amount of tape that was on these rolls, and I have to agree that there wasn't as much, but for me that was a minor negative.  I think this tape is pretty great and sure is convenient.The finish on this tape is ideal for gifts in that it tends to disappear over most types of wrapping, to give that special present a little extra touch beyond straight plastic tape.This tape has an excellent adhesive, sticking to paper or foil with no problem.  As advertised, the tape is almost invisible on the package.  Scotch make quality tape and this is no exception.Scotch Gift tape is a great product for its intended purpose - wrapping gifts.  The tape is much less noticeable on typical gift wrap than either Scotch Magic Tape (which is a bit too matte for this purpose) or shiny generic tapes.But I have to mark down this particular product down because the amount of product given is so stingy.  Each roll only has 300 inches of tape - compare this to a a Scotch Magic Tape refill that I had sitting in my cabinet that was 1296 inches long.  And I dislike the fact that the product description on Amazon says nothing about how much tape is included, so you won't realize the issue until you get your order.The tape is not shiny it has a matte finish and doesn't stick out when used on gift wrap. It also tears easily with the dispenser it comes in.It is good and sticky. The glue didn't wear off at all.This new gift wrapping tape and the Scotch brand magic transparent tape I have been using for years are very similar. The old tape is translucent with a foggy finish. The new tape is slightly clearer and more glossy. It doesn't accept ink or pencil marks so easily, but you can write on it with a Sharpie.Overall, the old tape is more useful.It's tape. How different can tape be ? Well very, with the Scotch people ! The gift wrap tape sealed all the package to the point where many receivers could not locate what was holding their presents together. I , for one , enjoyed the frustration on their faces trying to open their gifts. Merry Christmas !You buy a nice gift and you want to wrap it for that special person to whom you are going to give it.  You found the perfect gift wrap paper, cut the paper perfectly and fold every crease to perfection.  Now use the best tape there is to seal the deal!Scotch Giftwrap Tape has a unique satin finish that helps the tape disappear on the wrapping paper.  It seals tightly and it is easy to dispense and cut.  It doesn't yellow or show air bubbles and provides the finishing touch on the package.  Tape that doesn't show up so much that it steals the beauty of your wrapping job.Don't forget the ribbon!this package of Scotch Gift Wrap Tape was a great help in wrapping gifts this season. The tape is sturdy and invisible against the wrapping paper background. The perforated edge makes it easy break the tape off it's role.The only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars is that I would have liked more tape per roll. We went through these 3 tape dispensers very quickly. I typically like to buy the larger rolls.  Otherwise, another great product from ScotchI recently testedScotch Magic(TM) Tape 3105, 3/4-inch x 300 Inches, 3-Packagainst Scotch's(R) Satin Finish Gift-wrap tape.  Both were both 3/4 inches wide.You can't go wrong with either of these products!  They both came in the very familiar and proven dispensers - nothing fancy, and they just work well.I was surprised to see that the Matte Finish product was actually more invisible than the Satin Finish Gift-wrap product - but unless you saw them side by side, you'd never know.The Satin Finish Gift Wrap Tape did allow me to easily remove or reposition the tape.  Either way, find the best price, keep it simple, and use either of these tape products - you will not be disappointed!If you are the person that wraps gifts with the comics section of the paper or buys 99 cent rolls of paper then this would be a bit of overkill for you. if you care about your package and you purchase high quality paper then you need this tape. it looks great! The satin finish can't be beat. For about 4 bucks you get about 27 yards of tape. I think that is quite acceptable. If you buy those 50 cent rolls from Big Lots or Walmart you will only get about 6 yards of tape per roll and its crappy tape.The one thing that annoys me to no end with this is the serrated cutting bar. If if were just a smidge wider than the tape it would work way better. Many times it has not cut the tape correctly unless it's just right-so annoying!I received this product free of charge to try through the vine program.Would I spend my own money on this? noYou are a person who cares about details.  The normalScotch Magic(TM) Tapeis fine for the hoi polloi.  "Invisible tape" they call it, the deluded fools.  But you can see its flaws, how it holds an air bubble, how it calls attention to itself with an ugly matte finish that makes anything below it look slightly washed out, faded like a painting left too long in a sunny room.You are a person who notices details.  When you are wrapping a gift -- with wrapping paper that folds just so, without little crinkles -- when you are wrapping a gift you want the smooth lover's touch of satin against your fingers, a shiny surface that light will caress into a soft shine.  It calls attention to itself only when the light walks ups to it, makes a graceful bow, and asks it to dance.You are a person who pays attention to details.  You like that this tape is determined "Photo Safe" according to the rigorous ISO Standard 14523.  You won't be seeing your fingerprints outlined in dirt and grease, trapped like some ancient insect in amber.  Yes, you might be frustrated that the dispenser leaves tiny lines where the tape meets the ledge with the jagged teeth and where it pulls out and away from the tight, perfect coil which 3M has so brilliantly engineered.  But you'll figure out this can be managed with skillful snips from a sharp set of scissors.The details are important to you.  Is it Scotch GiftWrap Tape or Scotch Giftwrap Tape?  The packaging says both.  Perhaps 3M should hire you to proofread the names of their products, you think to yourself, with a congratulatory inner voice.  You wouldn't let a detail like that slip by.I've been using Scotch Gift Wrap Tape for years and there is nothing better. Cheaper tape can be fine for general purpose taping (although I still prefer 3M products), but for gift-wrapping, quality is a must. This tape dispenses evenly and easily, cuts cleanly, applies easily, and is truly nearly invisible once applied. The tape holds well as long as stress is lateral to the tape. When the stress is perpendicular to the tape, it sometimes lifts. This is rarely the case when gift-wrapping. I think it is slightly less tacky than general-purpose tape. Sometimes you can lift it off if you make a mistake, but gift-wrap paper tends to be unforgiving. Because it is nearly invisible when applied, it is often best to cut the seam and leave the tape on the paper if you make a mistake. It is not noticeable. There is not must else to say about tape.This special tape is perfect for holiday wrapping chores. It adheres well, is less likely than many to tangle, and has a nice finish that disappears on the paper once it's been applied. I've too often bought bargain-brand tape for the holidays, and it is just not worth it. The difficulties using those flimsy tape dispensers and lousy cutters, not to mention the tendency to curl up and tangle, make wrapping a chore. Well, this tape doesn't make wrapping a pleasure, but it does make it easy and quick, with a lovely professional appearance.I know, it's tape.  Scotch tape to be precise.  But that is what sets this tape apart from the competition.  Over the years, I've had consistently better results with all forms of Scotch adhesive products.  The difference is so noticeable that I buy Scotch tape products exclusively, regardless of price.  And speaking of price, this is a very good price for a three pack of Scotch tape!Scotch tape:* sticks better* cuts better* tends to bend more naturally* doesn't seem to yellow/discolor as muchThis "gift tape" has a matte finish that hides finger prints and largely disappears on your gifts.  If you're looking for a matte-finish tape, I'd definitely start here.Last year when I ran into a gift wrapping crisis (ran out of tape at night while the kids were in bed and my husband was on a business trip) I called a neighbor and asked if she had tape I could borrow.  She showed up at my door with a three pack of Scotch Gift Wrap tape.  While it wasn't my preferred tape [I like the Magic Scotch tape] it was tape and it allowed me to get the job done.I like this gift wrap tape, but I don't love it.  One gripe I have with this tape is it's tougher than the magic tape.  Because it's sturdier, it's not as easy to rip it off the dispenser.  Numerous times I have gone to cut off a piece of this tape and it has bunched up on me.  I never have that problem with the magic tape.  This tape seems to be more adhesive than the magic tape as well.  Once you put this on the gift wrap you aren't getting it off without damaging the paper unless you're using the fancier foil wraps.  This feature is nice if you're trying to discourage peekers, but it's not so great if you're like me and you forgot what was in a particular unmarked package.I do like how nicely this tape disappears when it's placed on gift wrap.  The satin finish allows it to nicely blend in on the paper and doesn't stand out like the glossy or the invisible tapes (my experience with the invisible tapes is you wind up with a matte spot that stands out on a satin finish).Like Kleenex, Zippers and Google, this is a product that's so good at what it does we pretty much refer to ALL similar items by its name: Scotch tape.Unlike other brands, however, this is a strong tape with a nice, satin finish that disappears against matte wrapping papers.  You don't even have to rub it like crazy with the back of your fingernail to make it invisible, like some inferior brands. If you're using a shiny foil paper you'll want to stick with a tape that has a similar, shiny finish. (Pardon the pun.)I used this tape, which has more of a sheen than regular "invisible" tape, on several different kinds of gift wrap. It definitely blends better with papers with a slight gloss to them since it has a similar texture. On matte-surfaced papers like tissue wrap, craft paper, and "natural" papers, the slight sheen of the tape makes it show up more. For those who like their wrappings to be really fancy, this tape is a nice addition to wrapping supplies. It would also work well on any project with paper that has a slight gloss to it.I have always liked Scotch brand products and this one is no different. I like that you get three rolls of this tape because if you are like me one is never enough when wrapping gifts. I love that the dispenser is easy to use. The tape comes off the roll very easily which is a huge plus in my opinion. I also love that the gift wrap tape is clear when you place in onto the wrapping paper. It makes the gifts a lot more appealing considering that you don't have to look at tape "lines". In my opinion the Scotch Gift Wrap Tape is the best tape for wrapping gifts this holiday season.If you want a tape that is easy to use and looks great on your gifts look no further than Scotch Gift Wrap Tape. I do not think that you will be disappointed.I always buy Scotch brand tape for use in my home (no idea what stuff they buy at the office - ugh), and this Gift Wrap tape is what I purchase by by the box load for all use year!The satin finish melts into giftwrap, and gives an especially nice finish to my packages. 3/4" is a good width for sealing giftwrap edges.  The finish looks good on matte or shiny paper, and holds well.  I usually take the roll out and put it in a weighted tape dispenser, so I can't comment on the roll dispenser it comes with.Scotch is my go-to brand for household and packaging tapes, and this is one of the styles I buy plenty of in the fall for all year use - Christmas, then birthdays, Mother and Father's Days, etc.  Another winner from the folks who do "sticky" right.I know, I know, terrible sense of humor.  This tape, however, works exactly as you'd expect, and even a little better.  It disappears on gift wrap paper that doesn't have a super glossy finish.  Almost every gift wrap that you'll find in stores will have a finish that works well with Scotch Gift Wrap Tape.The convenient three pack has plenty of tape for a pampered child's birthday or for three of Santa's elves to wrap a reindeer load of gifts. (Seriously, 25 yds. of tape is a whole lot of tape)For those of you traveling this holiday season with a small child who must be quiet, I offer one other use for this tape.  Give your little kid a roll of tape and let him/her play with it.  They'll have strips of tape going all over the airplane seat and the tiny amount of space alotted to a passenger.  When the plane lands, and Junior has finished with his tape, just roll it up into a ball and toss it into the closest trash container.  I can't guarantee that this will work for everyone, but it kept my 2 year old quiet in her car seat during a 9 hour flight to Europe.  She played with the tape until she tired of it, then fell asleep as I removed the played-with tape.Scotch brand of tape is an oldie but goody, and its gift wrap tape is no different. The clear tape all but disappears on wrapping paper. It's strong and gets the job done. Highly recommend.Love the gift wrap tape!  One of my favorite activities in the world is wrapping gifts.  I don't know why.  I just love matching bows and ribbons with the paper!  The great part about special gift wrap tape is that it is designed specifically to be invisible against wrapping paper--not only is it transparent, but the ends blend into the paper.  To this end, the Scotch Gift Wrap tape almost always succeeds.  The only time it doesn't, however, is when you have shiny or textured wrapping paper--which I occasionally use.  But you can't win them all.  Oh, and as far as using cheapie off-brands...Well, there's always some items when you should always buy name brand:  aluminum foil, saran wrap, toilet paper, AND duct or adhesive tape.  That's just my honest opinion.It's really great tape.  It disappears onto semi-glossy to glossy gift wrap paper, but it's got a slight sheen that will catch light on school projects.  If you want tape that completely disappears on matte surfaces, go for the magic tape instead of this one.In a way, I feel a bit silly reviewing tape, especially one that have been out for a very long time, which I has used fairly often, though not in a few years until I just got it about a month ago, but it feels odd, but regardless people need to know the truth about this tape!!!In all seriousness, this tape, as are most 3MM products, wonderful.  It works as intended and sticks to the wrapping paper and has a slightly matte finish, but not the same kind of "white" matte finish that the tape Scotch tape in the green package comes in, its almost a clear matte finish, and this is really the point of the tape.  If you use the shiny finish, or a packaging tape, its too shiny and shows up too much on the paper because of its shine, and if you use the normal matte finish to tape the gift wrap, it will be just as obvious because it makes that area a lighter color, but this tape, does about as well as you can expect a tape of its kind to do, it sticks and its not screaming "LOOK AT ME" on the gift wrap because its too shiny or too matte, it has a good balance and thus is a good tape for gift wrapping, I suppose you could use staples or double sided tape (I have done both), but you know, sometimes, just good ol' tape works best.  :DGod Bless ~AmyI used this tape over the holidays for all my gift wrapping, and was very pleased with how it performed.First, it really does disappear on most gift wraps -- only on the shiniest foil wrap was I able to see the tape.  It has a subtle satin finish that just blends easily with ... well .. almost everything.  Second, it holds VERY securely.  If you're used to lesser tapes that let you carefully peel and reposition a flap, you'll soon find that this tape behaves
