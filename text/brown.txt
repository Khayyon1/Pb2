Furthermore , as an encouragement to revisionist thinking , it manifestly is fair to admit that any fraternity has a constitutional right to refuse to accept persons it dislikes .The Unitarian clergy were an exclusive club of cultivated gentlemen -- as the term was then understood in the Back Bay -- and Parker was definitely not a gentleman , either in theology or in manners .Ezra Stiles Gannett , an honorable representative of the sanhedrin , addressed himself frankly to the issue in 1845 , insisting that Parker should not be persecuted or calumniated and that in this republic no power to restrain him by force could exist .Even so , Gannett judiciously argued , the Association could legitimately decide that Parker `` should not be encouraged nor assisted in diffusing his opinions by those who differ from him in regard to their correctness '' .We today are not entitled to excoriate honest men who believed Parker to be downright pernicious and who barred their pulpits against his demand to poison the minds of their congregations .One can even argue -- though this is a delicate matter -- that every justification existed for their returning the Public Lecture to the First Church , and so to suppress it , rather than let Parker use it as a sounding board for his propaganda when his turn should come to occupy it .Finally , it did seem clear as day to these clergymen , as Gannett's son explained in the biography of his father , they had always contended for the propriety of their claim to the title of Christians .Their demand against the Calvinist Orthodoxy for intellectual liberty had never meant that they would follow `` free inquiry '' to the extreme of proclaiming Christianity a `` natural '' religion .Grant all this -- still , when modern Unitarianism and the Harvard Divinity School recall with humorous affection the insults Parker lavished upon them , or else argue that after all Parker received the treatment he invited , they betray an uneasy conscience .Whenever New England liberalism is reminded of the dramatic confrontation of Parker and the fraternity on January 23 , 1843 -- while it may defend the privilege of Chandler Robbins to demand that Parker leave the Association , while it may plead that Dr. N. L. Frothingham had every warrant for stating , `` The difference between Trinitarians and Unitarians is a difference in Christianity ; ;the difference between Mr. Parker and the Association is a difference between no Christianity and Christianity '' -- despite these supposed conclusive assurances , the modern liberal heaves repeatedly a sigh of relief , of positive thanksgiving , that the Association never quite brought itself officially to expel Parker .Had it done so , the blot on its escutcheon would have remained indelible , nor could the Harvard Divinity School assemble today to honor Parker's insurgence other than by getting down on its collective knees and crying `` peccavi '' .Happily for posterity , then , the Boston Association did not actually command Parker to leave the room , though it came too close for comfort to what would have been an unforgivable brutality .Fortunately , the honor of the denomination can attest that Cyrus Bartol defended Parker's sincerity , as did also Gannett and Chandler Robbins ; ;whereupon Parker broke down into convulsions of weeping and rushed out of the room , though not out of the Fellowship .In the hall , after adjournment , Dr. Frothingham took him warmly by the hand and requested Parker to visit him -- whereupon our burly Theodore again burst into tears .All this near tragedy , which to us borders on comedy , enables us to tell the story over and over again , always warming ourselves with a glow of complacency .It was indeed a near thing , but somehow the inherent decency of New England ( which we inherit ) did triumph .Parker was never excommunicated .To the extent that he was ostracized or even reviled , we solace ourselves by saying he asked for it .Yet , even after all these stratagems , the conscience of Christian liberality is still not laid to rest , any more than is the conscience of Harvard University for having done the abject penance for its rejection of Ralph Waldo Emerson's The Divinity School Address of naming its hall of philosophy after him .In both cases the stubborn fact remains : liberalism gave birth to two brilliant apostates , both legitimate offspring of its loins , and when brought to the test , it behaved shabbily .Suppose they both had ventured into realms which their colleagues thought infidel : is this the way gentlemen settle frank differences of opinion ? ?Is it after all possible that no matter how the liberals trumpet their confidence in human dignity they are exposed to a contagion of fear more insidious than any conservative has ever to worry about ? ?However , there is a crucial difference between the two histories .Emerson evaded the problem by shoving it aside , or rather by leaving it behind him : he walked out of the Unitarian communion , so that it could lick the wound of his departure , preserve its self-respect and eventually accord him pious veneration .Parker insisted upon not resigning , even when the majority wanted him to depart , upon daring the Fellowship to throw him out .Hence he was in his lifetime , as is the memory of him afterwards , a canker within the liberal sensitivity .He still points an accusing finger at all of us , telling us we have neither the courage to support him nor the energy to cut his throat .Actually , the dispute between Parker and the society of his time , both ecclesiastical and social , was a real one , a bitter one .It cannot be smoothed over by now cherishing his sarcasms as delightful bits of self-deprecation or by solemnly calling for a reconsideration of the justice of the objections to him .The fact is incontestable : that liberal world of Unitarian Boston was narrow-minded , intellectually sterile , smug , afraid of the logical consequences of its own mild ventures into iconoclasm , and quite prepared to resort to hysterical repressions when its brittle foundations were threatened .Parker , along with Garrison and Charles Sumner , showed a magnificent moral bravery when facing mobs mobilized in defense of the Mexican War and slavery .Nevertheless , we can find reasons for respecting even the bigotry of the populace ; ;their passions were genuine , and the division between them and the abolitionists is clear-cut .But Parker as the ultra-liberal minister within the pale of a church which had proclaimed itself the repository of liberality poses a different problem , which is not to be resolved by holding him up as the champion of freedom .Even though his theological theses have become , to us , commonplaces , the fundamental interrogation he phrased is very much with us .It has been endlessly rephrased , but I may here put it thus : at what point do the tolerant find themselves obliged to become intolerant ? ?And then , as they become aware that they have reached the end of their patience , what do they , to their dismay , learn for the first time about themselves ? ?There can be no doubt , the Boston of that era could be exquisitely cruel in enforcing its canons of behavior .The gentle Channing , revered by all Bostonians , orthodox or Unitarian , wrote to a friend in Louisville that among its many virtues Boston did not abound in a tolerant spirit , that the yoke of opinion crushed individuality of judgment and action : `` No city in the world is governed so little by a police , and so much by mutual inspections and what is called public sentiment .We stand more in awe of one another than most people .Opinion is less individual or runs more into masses , and often rules with a rod of iron '' .Even more poignantly , and with the insight of a genius , Channing added -- remember , this is Channing , not Parker ! !-- that should a minister in Boston trust himself to his heart , should he `` speak without book , and consequently break some law of speech , or be hurried into some daring hyperbole , he should find little mercy '' .Channing wrote this -- in a letter ! !I think it fair to say that he never quite reached such candor in his sermons .But Theodore Parker , commencing his mission to the world-at-large , disguised as the minister of a `` twenty-eighth Congregational Church '' which bore no resemblance to the Congregational polities descended from the founders ( among which were still the Unitarian churches ) , made explicit from the beginning that the conflict between him and the Hunkerish society was not something which could be evaporated into a genteel difference about clerical decorum .Because he spoke openly with what Channing had prophesied someone might -- with daring hyperbole -- Parker vindicated Channing's further prophecy that he who committed this infraction of taste would promptly discover how little mercy liberals were disposed to allow to libertarians who appeared to them libertines .An institutionalized liberalism proved itself fundamentally an institution , and only within those defined limits a license .By reminding ourselves of these factors in the situation , we should , I am sure , come to a fresh realization , however painful it be , that the battle between Parker and his neighbors was fought in earnest .He arraigned the citizens in language of so little courtesy that they had to respond with , at the least , resentment .What otherwise could `` the lawyer , doctor , minister , the men of science and letters '' do when told that they had `` become the cherubim and seraphim and the three archangels who stood before the golden throne of the merchant , and continually cried , ' Holy , holy , holy is the Almighty Dollar ' `` ? ?Nor , when we recollect how sensitive were the emotions of the old Puritan stock in regard to the recent tides of immigration , should we be astonished that their thin lips were compressed into a white line of rage as Parker snarled at them thus : `` Talk about the Catholics voting as the bishop tells ! !Reproach the Catholics for it ! !You and I do the same thing .There are a great many bishops who have never had a cross on their bosom , nor a mitre on their head , who appeal not to the authority of the Pope at Rome , but to the Almighty Dollar , a pope much nearer home .Boston has been controlled by a few capitalists , lawyers and other managers , who told the editors what to say and the preachers what to think '' .This was war .Parker meant business .And he took repeated care to let his colleagues know that he intended them : `` Even the Unitarian churches have caught the malaria , and are worse than those who deceived them '' -- which implied that they were very bad indeed .It was `` Duty '' he said that his parents had given him as a rule -- beyond even the love that suffused his being and the sense of humor with which he was largely supplied -- and it was duty he would perform , though it cost him acute pain and exhausted him by the age of fifty .Parker could weep -- and he wept astonishingly often and on the slightest provocation -- but the psychology of those tears was entirely compatible with a remorseless readiness to massacre his opponents .`` If it gave me pleasure to say hard things '' , he wrote , `` I would shut up forever '' .We have to tell ourselves that when Parker spoke in this vein , he believed what he said , because he could continue , `` But the truth , which cost me bitter tears to say , I must speak , though it cost other tears hotter than fire '' .Because he copiously shed his own tears , and yielded himself up as a living sacrifice to the impersonalized conscience of New England , he was not disturbed by the havoc he worked in other people's consciences .Our endeavor to capture even a faint sense of how strenuous was the fight is muffled by our indifference to the very issue which in the Boston of 1848 seemed to be the central hope of its Christian survival , that of the literal , factual historicity of the miracles as reported in the Four Gospels .It is idle to ask why we are no longer disturbed if somebody , professing the deepest piety , decides anew that it is of no importance whether or not Christ transformed the water into wine at eleven A.M. on the third of August , A.D. 32 .We have no answer as to why we are not alarmed .So we are the more prepared to give Parker the credit for having taken the right side in an unnecessary controversy , to salute his courage , and to pass on , happily forgetting both him and the entire episode .We have not the leisure , or the patience , or the skill , to comprehend what was working in the mind and heart of a then recent graduate from the Harvard Divinity School who would muster the audacity to contradict his most formidable instructor , the majesterial Andrews Norton , by saying that , while he believed Jesus `` like other religious teachers '' , worked miracles , `` I see not how a miracle proves a doctrine '' .The missionary obligation to proclaim the gospel to all the world was once left to zealous individuals and voluntary societies .But the time came when a church that had no part in the missionary movement was looked upon as deficient in its essential life .The Christian education of children , too , was once hardly more than a sideshow , but the day came when a congregation that did not assume full oversight of a church school was thought of as failing in its duty .The most serious weakness of the ecumenical movement today is that it is generally regarded as the responsibility of a few national leaders in each denomination and a few interdenominational executives .Most pastors and laymen , even though they believe it to be important , assume that the ecumenical movement lies outside the province of their parishes .They may even dismiss it from their minds as something that concerns only the `` ecclesiastical Rover Boys '' , as someone has dubbed them , who like to go to national and international assemblies , and have expense accounts that permit them to do so .As long as this point of view prevails , the ecumenical movement will be lame and halt .The next stage ahead is that of making it thoroughly at home in the local community .Progress will take place far less through what is done in any `` summit conference '' of the National Council or the World Council , or even in offices of the denominational boards , than through what happens in the communities where Christian people live together as neighbors .The front line of advance is where witnessing and worshiping congregations of different traditions exist side by side .Until they see the ecumenical movement in terms of the difference it makes in their own attitudes , programs , and relationships , it will have an inevitable aspect of unreality .As things now stand , there is a grievous disparity between the unity in Christ which we profess in ecumenical meetings and the complacent separateness of most congregations on any Main Street in the nation .The ecumenical congregationThe crux of ecumenical advance is an even more personalized matter than the relation between congregations in the same community .The decisive question is what happens within each congregation and , finally , in the minds and hearts of the individual members .It is here that the local and ecumenical must meet .It is here that the ecumenical must become local and the local become ecumenical .It has become almost trite to say that the ecumenical movement must be `` carried down to the grass roots '' .This way of describing the matter is unfortunate .It implies two misconceptions .One is that whatever is ecumenical has to do with some over-all organization at `` the top '' and needs only to be understood at the so-called `` lower levels '' .The truth , however , is that the ecumenical church is just the local church in its own true character as an integral unit of the whole People of God throughout the world .The other misconception is that our ecumenical problems will be solved if only the knowledge of the church in its world-wide extension and its interdenominational connections , now comprehended by many national leaders , can be communicated to all congregations .However needed this may be , the fundamental problem is not information but active commitment to the total mission of the church of Christ in the world .The basic unit in the church , of whatever denominational polity , is always the congregation .It is hardly possible to emphasize this too much .Most people do not realize that the congregation , as a gathered fellowship meeting regularly face to face , personally sharing in a common experience and expressing that experience in daily relationships with one another , is unique .The idea that it is a feature of all religions is entirely mistaken .The Jewish synagogue affords a parallel to the Christian congregation , but Hinduism , Buddhism , Islam , Confucianism , Taoism , Shintoism , although they have sacred scriptures , priests , spiritual disciplines , and places of prayer , do not have a congregation as a local household of faith and love .Their characteristic experience is that of the individual at an altar or a shrine rather than that of a continuing social group with a distinctive kind of fellowship .How far the fellowship in most local churches falls below what the New Testament means by koinonia ! !What is now called Christian fellowship is often little more than the social chumminess of having a gracious time with the kind of people one likes .The koinonia of Acts and of the Epistles means sharing in a common relation to Christ .It is an experience of a new depth of community derived from an awareness of the corporate indwelling of Christ in His people .As Dietrich Bonhoffer puts it , `` Our community with one another consists solely in what Christ has done to both of us '' .This may mean having fellowship in the church with people with whom , on the level of merely human agreeableness , we might prefer not to have any association at all .There is a vast difference between the community of reconciliation which the New Testament describes and the community of congeniality found in the average church building .Whenever a congregation really sees itself as a unit in the universal Church , in vital relation with the whole Body of Christ and participating in His mission to the world , a necessary foundation-stone of the ecumenical movement has been laid .The antithesis of the ecumenical and the local then no longer exists .The local and the ecumenical are one .Of course , the perspective of those who are dealing directly with the world-wide problems of the People of God will always be different from the perspective of those who are dealing with the nearby problems of particular persons in a particular place .Each viewpoint is valid if it is organically related to the other .Neither is adequate if it stands alone .Our difficulty arises when either viewpoint shuts out the other .And this is what all too often happens .Divergent perspectivesA little parable illustrative of this truth is afforded by an incident related by Professor Bela Vasady at the end of the Second World War .With great difficulty he made his way from his native Hungary to Geneva to renew his contacts as a member of the Provisional Committee for the World Council of Churches .When he had the mishap of breaking his spectacles , his ecumenical colleagues insisted on providing him with new ones .They were bifocals .He often spoke of them as his `` ecumenical '' glasses and used them as a symbol of the kind of vision that is required in the church .It is , he said , a bifocal vision , which can see both the near-at-hand and the distant and keep a Christian in right relation to both .As things stand now , the local and the ecumenical tend to compete with each other .On the one hand , there are ecumenists who are so stirred by the crises of the church in its encounter with the world at large that they have no eyes for what the church is doing in their own town .They do not escape the pitfall into which Charles Dickens pictured Mrs. Jellyby as falling .Her concern for the natives of Borrioboola-Gha was so intense that she quite forgot and neglected her son Peepy ! !Likewise , the ecumenist may become so absorbed in the conflict of the church with the totalitarian state in East Germany , the precarious situation of the church in revolutionary China , and the anguish of the church over apartheid in South Africa that he loses close contact with the parish church in its unspectacular but indispensable ministry of worship , pastoral service and counseling , and Christian nurture for a face-to-face group of individuals .On the other hand , many a pastor is so absorbed in ministering to the intimate , personal needs of individuals in his congregation that he does little or nothing to lead them into a sense of social responsibility and world mission .As a result , they go on thinking of the church , with introverted and self-centered satisfaction , only in connection with the way in which it serves them and their families .It would hardly be an exaggeration to say that ninety per cent of the energy of most churches -- whether in terms of finance or spiritual concern -- is poured into the private and domestic interests of the members .The parish lives for itself rather than for the community or the world .The gap between the ecumenical perspective and the parish perspective appears most starkly in a church in any of our comfortable suburbs .It is eminently successful according to all conventional standards .It is growing in numbers .Its people are agreeable friends .It has a beautiful edifice .Its preaching and its music give refreshment of spirit to men and women living under heavy strain .It provides pastoral care for the sick and troubled .It helps children grow up with at least a nodding acquaintance with the Bible .It draws young people into the circle of those who continue the life of the church from generation to generation .And it is easy for the ecumenical enthusiast to lose sight of how basic all this is .But what is this church doing to help its members understand their roles as Christians in the world ? ?All too often its conception of parish ministry and pastoral care includes no responsibility for them in their relation to issues of the most desperate urgency for the life of mankind .It is not stirring them to confront the racial tensions of today with the mind of Christ .It is not helping them face the moral crisis involved in the use of nuclear energy .It is not making them sensitive to the sub-Christian level of much of our economic and industrial life .It is raising no disturbing question as to what Christian stewardship means for the relationship of the richest nation in the world to economically underdeveloped peoples .It is not developing an awareness of the new kind of missionary strategy that is called for as young churches emerge in Asia and Africa .To put it bluntly , many a local church is giving its members only what they consciously want .It is not disturbing them by thoughts of their Christian responsibility in relation to the world .We shall not make a decisive advance in the ecumenical movement until such a church begins to see itself not merely as a haven of comfort and peace but as a base of Christian witness and mission to the world .There is a humorous but revealing story about a rancher who owned a large slice of Texas and who wanted to have on it everything that was necessary for a completely pleasant community .He built a school and a library , then a recreation center and an inn .Desiring to fill the only remaining lack , he selected the best site on the ranch for a chapel and spared no expense in erecting it .A visitor to the beautiful little building inquired , `` Do you belong to this church , Mr. Rancher '' ? ?`` Why , no , ma'am '' , he replied , `` this church belongs to me '' ! !The story reflects the way too many people feel .As long as the congregation regards the church as `` our '' church , or the minister thinks of it as `` my '' church , just so long the ecumenical movement will make no significant advance .There must first be a deeper sense that the church belongs not to us but to Christ , and that it is His purpose , not our own interests and preferences , that determines what it is to be and do .Local embodiment of the wholeA local church which conceives its function to be entirely that of ministering to the conscious desires and concerns of its members tends to look on everything ecumenical as an extra , not as a normal aspect of its own life as a church .It would doubtless be greatly surprised to be told that in failing to be ecumenical it is really failing to be the Church of Christ .Yet the truth , according to the New Testament , is that every local church has its existence only by being the embodiment of the whole church in that particular place .Unfortunately , however , and for reasons to be discussed in the following chapter , no rate relationships can be made completely nondiscriminatory as long as all or some of the rates must be set above marginal costs in order to yield adequate revenues .And this fact may explain some of the disagreements among the experts as to the more rational formulas for the apportionment of total costs among different units of service .One such disagreement , which will receive attention in this next chapter , concerns the question whether rates for different kinds of service , in order to avoid the attribute of discrimination , must be made directly proportional to marginal costs , or whether they should be based instead on differences in marginal costs .Here , the choice is that between the horns of a dilemma .Two major types of fully distributed cost analysis1 .The double-step typeDespite an ambiguity due to its failure clearly to define `` relative costs '' , the above exposition of fully distributed costing goes about as far as one can go toward expressing the basic philosophy of the practice .For more explicit expositions , one must distinguish different types of analyses .By all means the most important distinction is that between those total-cost apportionments which superimpose a distribution of admittedly unallocable cost residues on estimates of incremental or marginal costs , and those other apportionments which recognize no difference between true cost allocation and mere total-cost distribution .The first , or double-step , type might also be called the `` railroad type '' because of its application to railroads ( and other transportation agencies ) by the Cost Section of the Interstate Commerce Commission .The Cost Section distinguishes between ( directly ) variable costs and constant costs in a manner noted in the preceding chapter .The variable costs alone are assigned to the different units of freight traffic as representing `` long-run out-of-pocket costs '' -- a term with a meaning here not distinctly different from that of the economist's `` long-run marginal costs '' .There remains a residue of total costs , or total `` revenue requirements '' which , since it is found to behave as if it were constant over substantial variations in traffic density , is strictly unallocable on a cost-finding basis .Nevertheless , because the Cost Section has felt impelled to make some kind of a distribution of total costs , it has apportioned this residue , which it sometimes calls `` burden '' , among the units of carload traffic on a basis ( partly ton , partly ton-mile ) which is concededly quite arbitrary from the standpoint of cost determination .In recent years , this burden ( which includes allowances for revenue deficiencies in the passenger business and in less-than-carload freight traffic ! !) has amounted to about one third of those total revenue requirements which the carload freight business is supposed to be called upon to meet .Since this book is concerned only incidentally with railroad rates , it will not attempt to analyze the methods by which the staff of the Interstate Commerce Commission has estimated out-of-pocket costs and apportioned residue costs .Suffice it to say that the usefulness of the latter apportionment is questionable .But in any event , full credit should be given to the Cost Section for its express and overt recognition of a vital distinction too often ignored in utility-cost analyses : namely , that between a cost allocation designed to reflect the actual behavior of costs in response to changes in rates of output of different classes of utility service ; ;and a mere cost apportionment which somehow spreads among the classes and units of service even those costs that are strictly unallocable from the standpoint of specific cost determination .2 .The single-step typeWe turn now to a type of fully distributed cost analysis which , unlike the `` railroad type '' , draws no distinction between cost allocation and cost apportionment : the single-step type .It might be called the `` public utility '' type because of the considerable use to which it has been put in gas and electric utility rate cases .Here no attempt is made , first to determine out-of-pocket or marginal costs and then to superimpose on these costs `` reasonably distributed '' residues of total costs .Instead , all of the total costs are treated as variable costs , although these costs are divided into costs that are deemed to be functions of different variables .Moreover , whereas in Interstate Commerce Commission parlance `` variable cost '' means a cost deemed to vary in direct proportion to changes in rate of output , in the type of analysis now under review `` variable cost '' has been used more broadly , so as to cover costs which , while a function of some one variable ( such as output of energy , or number of customers ) , are not necessarily a linear function .As already noted in an earlier paragraph , the more familiar cost analyses of utility enterprises or utility systems divide the total costs among a number of major classes of service , such as residential , commercial , industrial power , street lighting , etc. .This `` grand division '' permits many costs to be assigned in their entirety to some one class , such as street lighting , or at least to be excluded completely from some important class or classes .High-tension industrial power service , for example , would not be charged with any share of the maintenance costs or capital costs of the low-tension distribution lines .But the major portions of the total costs of a utility business are common or joint to all , or nearly all , classes of customers ; ;and these costs must somehow be apportioned among the various classes and then must somehow be reapportioned among the units of service in order to report unit costs that can serve as tentative measures of reasonable rates .The general basis on which these common costs are assigned to differently measured units of service will be illustrated by the following highly simplified problem of an electric-utility cost analysis .But before turning to this example , we must distinguish two subtypes of analysis , both of which belong to the single-step type rather than to the double-step type .In the first subtype , the analyst ( following the practice of railroad analysis in this particular respect ) distributes both total operating costs and total annual capital costs ( including an allowance for `` cost of capital '' or `` fair rate of return '' ) among the different classes and units of service .Here , an apportionment , say , of $5,000,000 of the total costs to residential service as a class would include an allowance of perhaps 6 per cent as the cost of whatever capital is deemed to have been devoted to the service of the residential consumers .But in the second subtype , which I take to be the one more frequently applied , only the operating expenses and not the `` cost of capital '' or `` fair return '' are apportioned directly among the various classes of service .To be sure , the capital investments in ( or , alternatively , the estimated `` fair values '' of ) the plant and equipment are apportioned among the different classes , as are also the gross revenues received from the sales of the different services .But any resulting excess of revenues received from a given class of service over the operating costs imputed to this class is reported as a `` return '' realized on the capital investment attributed to the same service .Thus , during any given year ( A ) if the revenues from the residential service are $7,000,000 , ( B ) if the operating expenses imputed to this class of service come to $5,000,000 , and ( C ) if the net investment in ( or value of ) the plant and equipment deemed devoted to this service amounts to $30,000,000 , the cost analyst will report that residential service , in the aggregate , has yielded a return of $2,000,000 or 6-2 per cent .Other services will show different rates of return , some probably much lower and some higher .There are obvious reasons of convenience for this practice of excluding `` cost of capital '' from the direct apportionment of annual costs among the different classes of service -- notably , the avoidance of the controversial question what rate of return should be held to constitute `` cost of capital '' or `` fair rate of return '' .But the practice is likely to be misleading , since it may seem to support a conclusion that , as long as the revenues from any class of service cover the imputed operating expenses plus some return on capital investment , however low , the rates of charge for this service are compensatory .Needless to say , any such inference would be quite unwarranted .For the reason just suggested , I shall assume the use of the first subtype of fully distributed cost apportionment in the following simplified example .That is to say , an allowance for `` cost of capital '' will be assumed to be included directly in the cost apportionment .Three-part analysis of the costs of an electric utility businessIn order to simplify the exposition of a typical fully apportioned cost analysis , let us assume the application of the analysis to an electric utility company supplying a single city with power generated by its own steam-generation plant .Let us also assume the existence of only one class or type of service , all of which is supplied at the same voltage , phase , etc. to residential , commercial , and industrial customers .This latter assumption will permit us to center attention on the most controversial aspect of modern public utility cost analysis -- the distinction among costs that are functions of outputs of the same service measured along different dimensions .Since the company under review is supplying what we are here regarding as only one kind of service , we might suppose that the problem of total cost apportionment would be very simple ; ;indeed , that it would be limited to a finding of the total annual operating and capital costs of the business , followed by a calculation of this total in terms of annual cost per kilowatt-hour of consumption .In fact , however , the problem is not so simple .For a statement of costs per kilowatt-hour would ignore the fact that many of these costs are not a function of kilowatt-hour output ( or consumption ) of energy .A recognition of multiple cost functions is therefore required .The simplest division , and the one most frequently used ( with subdivisions ) in gas and electric rate cases , is a threefold division of the total operating and capital costs into `` customer costs '' , `` energy '' or `` volumetric costs '' , and `` demand '' or `` capacity '' costs .If this threefold division of costs were to have its counterpart in the actual rates of charge for service , as it actually does have in some rates , there would result a three-part rate for any one class of service .For example , the monthly bill of a residential consumer might be the sum of a $1 customer charge , a $5 charge for 250 kilowatt-hours of energy atper kilowatt-hour , and a $2 charge for a maximum demand of 2 kilowatts during the month at the rate of $1 per kilowatt -- a total bill of $8 for that month .But our present interest lies in the measurement of costs of service , and only indirectly in rates that may or may not be designed to cover these costs .Let us therefore consider each of the three types of cost in turn , recognizing that this simplified classification is used only for illustrative purposes ; ;costs actually vary in much more complex ways .1 .The customer costsThese are those operating and capital costs found to vary with number of customers regardless , or almost regardless , of power consumption .Included as a minimum are the costs of metering and billing along with whatever other expenses the company must incur in taking on another consumer .These minimum costs may come to $1 per month , more or less , for residential and small commercial customers , although they are substantially higher for large industrial users , who require more costly connections and metering devices .While costs on this order are sometimes separately charged for in residential and commercial rates , in the form of a mere `` service charge '' , they are more frequently wholly or partly covered by a minimum charge which entitles the consumer to a very small amount of gas or electricity with no further payment .But the really controversial aspect of customer-cost imputation arises because of the cost analyst's frequent practice of including , not just those costs that can be definitely earmarked as incurred for the benefit of specific customers but also a substantial fraction of the annual maintenance and capital costs of the secondary ( low-voltage ) distribution system -- a fraction equal to the estimated annual costs of a hypothetical system of minimum capacity .In tradition and in poetry , the marriage bed is a place of unity and harmony .The partners each bring to it unselfish love , and each takes away an equal share of pleasure and joy .At its most ecstatic moments , husband and wife are elevated far above worldly cares .Everything else is closed away .This is the ideal .But marriage experts say that such mutual contribution and mutual joy are seldom achieved .Instead one partner or the other dominates the sexual relationship .In the past , it has been the husband who has been dominant and the wife passive .But today there are signs that these roles are being reversed .In a growing number of American homes , marriage counselors report , the wife is taking a commanding role in sexual relationships .It is she who decides the time , the place , the surroundings , and the frequency of the sexual act .It is she who says aye or nay to the intimate questions of sexual technique and mechanics -- not the husband .The whole act is tailored to her pleasure , and not to theirs .Beyond a certain point , of course , no woman can be dominant -- nature has seen to that .But there is little doubt that in many marriages the wife is boss of the marital bed .Of course , there remain many `` old-fashioned '' marriages in which the husband maintains his supremacy .Yet even in these marriages , psychologists say , wives are asserting themselves more strongly .The meekest , most submissive wife of today is a tiger by her mother's or grandmother's standards .To many experts , this trend was inevitable .They consider it simply a sign of our times .Our society has `` emancipated '' the woman , giving her new independence and new authority .It is only natural that she assert herself in the sexual role .`` The sexual relationship does not exist in a vacuum '' , declares Dr. Mary Steichen Calderone , medical director of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and author of the recent book , Release From Sexual Tensions .`` It reflects what is going on in other areas of the marriage and in society itself .A world in which wives have taken a more active role is likely to produce sexual relationships in which wives are more self-assertive , too '' .Yet many psychologists and marriage counselors agree that domination of the sex relationship by one partner or the other can be unhealthy and even dangerous .It can , in fact , wreck a marriage .When a husband is sexually selfish and heedless of his wife's desires , she is cheated of the fulfillment and pleasure nature intended for her .And she begins to regard him as savage , bestial and unworthy .On the other hand , wifely supremacy demeans the husband , saps his self-respect , and robs him of his masculinity .He is a target of ridicule to his wife , and often -- since private affairs rarely remain private -- to the outside world as well .`` A marriage can survive almost any kind of stress except an open and direct challenge to the husband's maleness '' , declares Dr. Calderone .This opinion is supported by one of the nation's leading psychiatrists , Dr. Maurice E. Linden , director of the Mental Health Division of the Philadelphia Department of Public Health .`` When the roles of husband and wife are reversed , so that the wife becomes leader and the husband follower '' , Dr. Linden says , `` the effects on their whole relationship , sexual and otherwise , can be disastrous '' .In one extreme case , cited by a Pittsburgh psychologist , an office worker's wife refused to have sexual relations with her husband unless he bought her the luxuries she demanded .To win her favors , her husband first took an additional job , then desperately began to embezzle from his employer .Caught at last , he was sentenced to prison .While he was in custody his wife divorced him .More typical is the case of a suburban Long Island housewife described by a marriage counselor .This woman repeatedly complained she was `` too tired '' for marital relations .To please her , her husband assumed some of the domestic chores .Finally , he was cooking , washing dishes , bathing the children , and even ironing -- and still his wife refused to have relations as often as he desired them .One wife , described by a New York psychologist , so dominated her husband that she actually placed their sexual relationship on a schedule , writing it down right between the weekly PTA meetings and the Thursday-night neighborhood card parties .Another put sex on a dollars-and-cents basis .After every money argument , she rebuffed her husband's overtures until the matter was settled in her favor .Experts say the partners in marriages like these can almost be typed .The wife is likely to be young , sophisticated , smart as a whip -- often a girl who has sacrificed a promising career for marriage .She knows the power of the sex urge and how to use it to manipulate her husband .The husband is usually a well-educated professional , preoccupied with his job -- often an organization man whose motto for getting ahead is : `` Don't rock the boat '' .Sometimes this leads to his becoming demandingly dominant in marriage .Hemmed in on the job and unable to assert himself , he uses the sex act so he can be supreme in at least one area .More often , though , he is so accustomed to submitting to authority on the job without argument that he lives by the same rule at home .Some psychologists , in fact , suggest that career-bound husbands often are more to blame for topsy-turvy marriages than their wives .The wife's attempt at control , these psychologists contend , is sometimes merely a pathetic effort to compel her husband to pay as much attention to her as he does to his job .Naturally no woman can ever completely monopolize the sexual initiative .Unless her husband also desires sex , the act cannot be consummated .Generally , however , in such marriages as those cited , the husband is at his wife's mercy .`` The pattern '' , says Dr. Morton Schillinger , psychologist at New York's Lincoln Institute for Psychotherapy , `` is for the husband to hover about anxiously and eagerly , virtually trembling in his hope that she will flash him the signal that tonight is the night '' .No one seriously contends , of course , that the domineering wife is , sexually speaking , a new character in our world .After all , the henpecked husband with his shrewish wife is a comic figure of long standing , in literature and on the stage , as Dr. Schillinger points out .There is no evidence that these Milquetoasts became suddenly emboldened when they crossed the threshhold of the master bedroom .Furthermore , Dr. Calderone says , a certain number of docile , retiring men always have been around .They aren't `` frigid '' and they aren't homosexual ; ;they're just restrained in all of life .They like to be dominated .One such man once confided to Dr. Theodor Reik , New York psychiatrist , that he preferred to have his wife the sexual aggressor .Asked why , he replied primly : `` Because that's no activity for a gentleman '' .But such cases were , in the past , unusual .Society here and abroad has been built around the dominating male -- even the Bible appears to endorse the concept .Family survival on our own Western frontier , for example , could quite literally depend on a man's strength and ability to bring home the bacon ; ;and the dependent wife seldom questioned his judgment about anything , including the marriage bed .This carried over into the more urbanized late 19th and early 20th centuries , when the man ruled the roost in the best bull-roaring Life With Father manner .In those days , a wife had mighty few rights in the domestic sphere and even fewer in the sexual sphere .`` Grandma wasn't expected to like it '' , Dr. Marion Hilliard , the late Toronto gynecologist , once summed up the attitude of the '90s .Wives of the period shamefacedly thought of themselves as `` used '' by their husbands -- and , history indicates , they often quite literally were .When was the turning point ? ?When did women begin to assert themselves sexually ? ?Some date it from woman suffrage , others from when women first began to challenge men in the marketplace , still others from the era of the emancipated flapper and bathtub gin .Virtually everyone agrees , however , that the trend toward female sexual aggressiveness was tremendously accelerated with the postwar rush to the suburbs .Left alone while her husband was miles away in the city , the modern wife assumed more and more duties normally reserved for the male .Circumstances gave her almost undisputed sway over child-rearing , money-handling and home maintenance .She found she could cope with all kinds of problems for which she was once considered too helpless .She liked this taste of authority and independence , and , with darkness , was not likely to give it up .`` Very few wives '' , says Dr. Calderone , `` who balance the checkbook , fix the car , choose where the family will live and deal with the tradesmen , are suddenly going to become submissive where sex is concerned .A woman who dominates other family affairs will dominate the sexual relationship as well '' .And an additional factor was helping to make women more sexually self-assertive -- the comparatively recent discovery of the true depths of female desire and response .Marriage manuals and women's magazine articles began to stress the importance of the female climax .They began to describe in detail the woman's capacity for response .In fact , the noted psychologist and sex researcher , Dr. Albert Ellis , has declared flatly that women are `` sexually superior '' to men .According to Dr. Ellis , the average 20-year-old American woman is capable of far greater sexual arousal than her partner .Not surprisingly , Dr. Ellis says , some recently enlightened wives are out to claim these capabilities .Yet , paradoxically , according to Dr. Maurice Linden , many wives despise their husbands for not standing up to them .An aggressive woman wants a man to demand , not knuckle under .`` When the husband becomes passive in the face of his wife's aggressiveness '' , Dr. Linden says , `` the wife , in turn , finds him inadequate .Often she fails to gain sexual satisfaction '' .One such wife , Dr. Linden says , became disgusted with her weak husband and flurried through a series of extramarital affairs in the hope of finding a stronger man .But her personality was such that each affair lasted only until that lover , too , had been conquered and reduced to passivity .Then the wife bed-hopped to the next on the list .In some cases , however , domination of the sex act by one partner can be temporary , triggered by a passing but urgent emotional need .Thus a man who is butting a stone wall at the office may become unusually aggressive in bed -- the one place he can still be champion .If his on-the-job problems work out , he may return to his old pattern .Sometimes a burst of aggressiveness will sweep over a man -- or his wife -- because he or she feels age creeping up .On the other hand , a husband who always has been vigorous and assertive may suddenly become passive -- asking , psychologists say , for reassurance that his wife still finds him desirable .Or a wife may make sudden demands that she be courted , flattered or coaxed , simply because she needs her ego lifted .In any case , Dr. Calderone remarks , such problems are a couple's own affair , and can't always be measured by a general yardstick .`` As long as the couple is in agreement in their approach to sex , it makes little difference if one or the other dominates '' , Dr. Calderone declares .`` The important point is that both be satisfied with the adjustment '' .Other experts say , however , that if sexual domination by one or the other partner exists for longer than a brief period , it is likely to shake the marriage .And just as domination today often begins with the wife , so the cure generally must lie with the husband .`` To get a marriage back where it belongs '' , comments Dr. Schillinger of the Lincoln Institute , `` the husband must take some very basic steps .He must begin , paradoxically , by becoming more selfish .He must become more expressive of his own desires , more demanding and less ' understanding ' '' .Too many husbands , Dr. Schillinger continues , worry about `` how well they're doing '' , and fear that their success depends on some trick or technique of sexual play .Eight , nine steps above him , Roberts had paused .Mickey paused with him , waiting , no longer impatient , trying now to think it out , do a little planning .He looked down over the banister at the hotel desk , with the telephone and pen set .If I could call in , they could check the story while we were on our way .I wouldn't have to tell them I had Roberts --Then he heard it , like a muffled thud , felt a subtle change in air pressure .He glanced up in time to see Roberts hurtling down on him from above , literally flying through the air , his bloody face twisted .Mickey tried to flatten against the banister , gripped it with one hand , but Roberts' full weight struck him at that moment in the groin .He gasped for air and the impact tore his hand from the rail .He tumbled with Roberts , helpless and in agony , over and over , down the steps .By a wrenching effort , he managed to hunch and draw in , to take the final fall on his back and shoulders rather than his head .He was fuzzy in his mind and , for a moment , helpless on the lobby floor , but he was conscious , and free of the weight of Roberts' body .When his vision cleared he saw the taller one scrambling upward , reaching .Mickey was on his knees when Roberts turned on the stairs and the razor flashed in his hand .He felt his empty pocket and knew that Roberts had retrieved the only weapon at hand .Mickey's eyes fixed on the other's feet , which would first betray the moment and direction of an attack .He rose stiffly , forcing his knees to lock .The knifelike pain in his groin nearly brought him down again .He made himself back off slowly , his eyes wary on Roberts , who now had no more to lose than he .The pain dulled as he moved , and he steadied inside .After a moment he extended one hand , the fingers curled .`` Come on '' , he said .`` You want to be that big a fool -- I was hoping for this '' .Roberts brushed at his eyes with his free hand and started down the steps .He held the razor well out to one side .He was invulnerable to attack , but he could be handled , Mickey knew , if he could be brought to make the first move .They were eight feet apart when Roberts cleared the last step .Mickey waited with slack arms .`` Any time , Roberts '' , he said .`` Or would it be easier if I put my hands in my pockets '' ? ?The taunt was lost on Roberts .He advanced slowly , directly , giving no hint of a feint to either side .He was just short of arm's reach when he stopped .Mickey backed off two steps , forcing him to come on again .There was a fixed grin on Roberts' face , made hideous by the swollen nose and the smeared blood .Mickey backed off again and Roberts hesitated , then came along .They moved in a series of rhythmic fits and starts , a macabre dance -- two steps back , two steps forward , two steps back .Mickey felt his shoulders come up against the wall beside the heavy slab front door .This was going to be it now , any second , and what he had to remember was to keep his eye on the razor , no matter what , even if Roberts should feint with a kick to the groin , the deadly hand was his exclusive concern .The kick came , sudden and vicious but short .Mickey's guts twisted with the effort , but he kept his eye on the weapon .It moved in a silver arc toward his throat , then veered downward .He hunched his left shoulder into it and slashed at Roberts' forearm with his own , felt the blade slide off his sleeve .Before Roberts could move inside to cut upward toward his face , he slammed his right fist into Roberts' belly .Roberts sagged and slashed at him wildly .Ducking , Mickey tripped and fell to one side , landing heavily on the wood floor .Then Roberts was on him , gasping for breath and for a couple of seconds Mickey lost sight of the blade .He felt it rip at the side of his jacket and a momentary sting under his left ribs .He got a knee up into Roberts' belly , used both hands and heaved him clear , then scrambled to his feet .They were in the center of the lobby now .Still clutching the razor , Roberts came up into a crouch , shaking his head .When he charged Mickey was ready .He hit Roberts with his left fist in the ribs and the razor cut toward him feebly , then wobbled in mid-air .With his right fist , and nearly all his weight behind it , he smashed at the bloodstained face .Roberts careened backward , his back arched , fought for balance and , failing , stumbled against the newel post at the foot of the stairs .The sound of his head striking the solid wood was an ultimate , sudden-end sound .He fell on his side across the lowest step , rolled over once , then lay still .Mickey found himself leaning against the desk , with stiff hands , panting for breath .After a minute he went to Roberts , looked at one of his eyes and felt for a pulse .He couldn't feel any .Roberts appeared to be dead ; ;if not yet , then soon , very soon .Suddenly it was cold in the lobby .12It seemed to him that a long time had passed before he decided what to do .Actually it was no more than eight or ten minutes , and the sum of his reasoning came to this :There's no way to take him in now and keep those other two -- Wister and the one who hired the two of them -- from finding out about Roberts and lamming out .The local law here would hold me till they check clear back home , and maybe more than that .They would have to .By then they could never catch up with the others .There's no other way ; ;I'll have to do it myself .He looked at where Roberts lay sprawled on the step .Mickey was sure now he was dead .One thing , he thought , nobody knows about it yet .Only me .He climbed the stairs , went into Roberts' room , found a suitcase and packed as much into it as he could .He left a few things .It didn't have to be perfect .Roberts was a wastrel .Walking away on impulse , he might logically leave behind what it was inconvenient to carry .When he had closed the suitcase he found a rag and moved about the room , wiping carefully everything he might have touched .It took him nearly an hour .He went to the room he had rented and got into his overcoat .He left the rest of his things and returned to the lobby .He set Roberts' suitcase near the front door , went outside and walked back to the garage .He was mildly surprised to find it was snowing .It snowed softly , silently , an undulating interruption of his vision against the night sky .He could feel it on his face and in his hair .He found the key to the Jeep , got it started and warmed it up for five minutes .Then he backed out and swung around to the front drive .He went into the hotel and searched till he found the razor .He put it in his own pocket for safekeeping .He took the suitcase out to the Jeep and put it in the front seat .Then he went back for Roberts .The body was heavier than he had anticipated .He got it onto his shoulder after some work and carried it outside and down to the Jeep .He dumped it into the back and made sure it wouldn't roll out , then returned to the porch and closed the front door , making sure it was unlocked .He drove carefully in the direction of the brief tour they had taken earlier .It snowed continuously , but quietly , evenly .When he reached the dip in the woods , he saw that already the earlier ruts were barely discernible .The Jeep fought its way through the low spot and got onto higher ground .He drove in low gear to the fork in the road and swung as close as possible to the entrance to the abandoned mine .He parked facing it and left the headlights on , but when he started into the tunnel with the suitcase , he found the illumination extended no farther than half a dozen feet into the passage .He went back and got the flashlight , returned to the tunnel and carried the suitcase to the edge of the pit he had found earlier .He tossed the bag into the pit and watched dry dust spray up around it .When the dust settled , he went back to the Jeep and carefully worked Roberts' body onto his shoulder .It wasn't like carrying the suitcase .The soft snow was deceitful underfoot .Twice he nearly fell .Inside the passage , he had to work his way over the fallen timber and nearly collapsed under his clumsy burden .By the time he reached the edge of the pit he was panting and his shoulder and back ached under the drag of the dead weight .He stood looking down for a few seconds , then backed up two or three paces from the edge .There was too much weight casually to toss it away .He could feel himself falling in with it and being unable to get out .It would be a bad place to die .It was a bad place for Roberts to wind up , but Roberts had asked for it .It was too late to worry about that .He knelt slowly and dumped the corpse onto the floor of the tunnel .It was a relief to get rid of the weight .He was shaking with tension and it took him a couple of minutes to get his breath and settle down .Then he got on his knees and rolled Roberts' body toward the edge .It hung momentarily on the point of dropping off .He gave it a strong push , heard it slide , then tumble dryly into the hole .He got to his feet and threw the flashlight beam into the pit .The body lay in an awkward sprawl twelve or fifteen feet below the level of the tunnel floor .Deep enough , he decided .There was little chance anyone would enter this shaft during the winter .The external signs of his approach to it would be covered by the snow , probably by the next day .It wasn't cold enough in the tunnel to preserve the body intact .By spring it would be a skeleton .He made his way back to the Jeep .He had started to back into the turn when he remembered the razor in his pocket .He climbed down , went back into the tunnel and tossed the razor into the pit .It landed on Roberts' sprawled right thigh , poised precariously , then slid off to the ground .He went back once more to the Jeep and started the short drive to the hotel .In the garage he checked the Jeep for signs of the use he had made of it .There were stains here and there and he cleaned them off , using an oiled rag he found on a nail .He wiped the steering wheel and all the places he might have touched the Jeep .He replaced the flashlight where it had been stowed , got into his own car and backed it out of the garage .There were tire marks where it had been , but they were overlapped by others and on the dusty floor would not be noticeable except under close scrutiny .Liz Peabody , he thought , might spend some time grieving for her lost lover , but he doubted that she would launch an investigation .He judged her to be a woman of some pride , though not much sense .Still she would probably have sense enough not to call in the local sheriff to find her boy friend who , apparently , had run away .Recent criticism of Great Expectations has tended to emphasize its symbolic and mythic content , to show , as M. D. Zabel has said of Dickens generally , that much of the novel's impact resides in its `` allegoric insight and moral metaphor '' .J. H. Miller's excellent chapter on Great Expectations has lately illustrated how fruitfully that novel can be read from such a perspective .In his analysis , however , he touches upon but fails to explore an idea , generally neglected in discussions of the book , which I believe is central to its art -- the importance of human hands as a recurring feature of the narrative .This essay seeks to make that exploration .Dickens was not for nothing the most theatrical of the great Victorian writers .He knew instinctively that next to voice and face an actor's hands are his most useful possession -- that in fiction as in the theatre , gesture is an indispensable shorthand for individualizing character and dramatizing action and response .It is hardly accidental , therefore , that many of his most vivid figures do suggestive or eccentric things with their hands .In Great Expectations the hands become almost an obsession .Mr. Jaggers habitually bites his forefinger , a gesture which conveys both contempt and the inscrutable abstractedness that half fascinates , half terrifies all who have dealings with him .Miss Havisham's withered hands , heavy as if her unhappiness were somehow concentrated in them , move in restless self-pity between her broken heart and her walking stick .Pumblechook's `` signature '' is the perpetually extended glad hand .Wemmick reveals his self-satisfaction by regularly rubbing his hands together .Old Mr. Pocket's frantic response to life imprisonment with a useless , social-climbing wife is to `` put his two hands into his disturbed hair '' and `` make an extraordinary effort to lift himself up by it '' , whereas Joe Gargery endures the shrewish onslaughts of Mrs. Joe by apologetically drawing `` the back of his hand across and across his nose '' .Such mannerisms would be less worthy of remark , were it not that in Great Expectations , as in no other of Dickens' novels , hands serve as a leitmotif of plot and theme -- a kind of unifying symbol or natural metaphor for the book's complex of human interrelationships and the values and attitudes that motivate them .Dickens not only reveals character through gesture , he makes hands a crucial element of the plot , a means of clarifying the structure of the novel by helping to define the hero's relations with all the major characters , and a device for ordering such diverse themes as guilt , pursuit , crime , greed , education , materialism , enslavement ( by both people and institutions ) , friendship , romantic love , forgiveness , and redemption .We have only to think of Lady Macbeth or the policeman-murderer in Thomas Burke's famous story , `` The Hands Of Mr. Ottermole '' , to realize that hands often call up ideas of crime and punishment .So it is with Great Expectations , whether the hands be Orlick's as he strikes down Mrs. Gargery or Pip's as he steals a pie from her pantry .Such associations suit well with the gothic or mystery-story aspects of Dickens' novel , but , on a deeper plane , they relate to the themes of sin , guilt , and pursuit that have recently been analyzed by other critics .The novel opens with a fugitive convict frantically trying to avoid the nemesis of being `` laid hands on '' -- a mysterious figure who looks into Pip's frightened eyes in the churchyard `` as if he were eluding the hands of the dead people , stretching up cautiously out of their graves , to get a twist upon his ankle and pull him in '' .Magwitch terrifies Pip into stealing a pork pie for him by creating the image in the boy's imagination of a bogy man who may `` softly creep his way to him and tear him open '' , `` imbruing his hands '' in him .As Pip agonizes over the theft that his own hands have committed , his guilty conscience projects itself upon the wooden finger of a local signpost , transforming it into `` a phantom devoting me to the Hulks '' .Held upside down in the graveyard , Pip clings in terror `` with both hands '' to his convict ; ;later he flees in panic from the family table just as his theft is about to be discovered and is blocked at the front door by a soldier who accusingly holds out a pair of handcuffs which he has brought to Gargery's forge for mending .Through such details Dickens indicates at the outset that guilt is a part of the ironic bond between Pip and Magwitch which is so unpredictably to alter both their lives .Since they commonly translate thoughts and feelings into deeds , hands naturally represent action , and since nearly half the characters in Great Expectations are of the underworld or closely allied to it , the linking of hands with crime or violence is not to be wondered at .Dickens , for excellent psychological reasons , never fully reveals Magwitch's felonious past , but Pip , at the convict's climactic reappearance in London , shrinks from clasping a hand which he fears `` might be stained with blood '' .Orlick slouches about the forge `` like Cain '' with `` his hands in his pockets '' , and when he shouts abuse at Mrs. Joe for objecting to his holiday , she claps her hands in a tantrum , beats them `` upon her bosom and upon her knees '' , and clenches them in her husband's hair .This last `` rampage '' is only the prelude to the vicious blow upon her head , `` dealt by some unknown hand '' whose identity is later revealed not verbally but through a manual action -- the tracing of Orlick's hammer upon a slate .Pip himself is to feel the terror of Orlick's `` murderous hand '' in his secret rendezvous at the sluicehouse on the marshes .Dickens lays great emphasis on the hands in this scene .Orlick shakes his hand at Pip , bangs the table with his fist , draws his unclenched hand `` across his mouth as if his mouth watered '' for his victim , lets his hands hang `` loose and heavy at his sides '' , and Pip observes him so intensely that he knows `` of the slightest action of his fingers '' .Orlick might almost be Magwitch's bogy man come alive , a figure of nemesis from Pip's phantasy of guilt .The scarred , disfigured wrists of Mr. Jaggers' housekeeper are the tell-tale marks of her sinister past , for her master , coolly exhibiting them to his dinner guests , makes a point of the `` force of grip there is in these hands '' .Jaggers' iron control over her ( `` she would remove her hands from any dish she put before him , hesitatingly , as if she dreaded his calling her back ) '' ) rests on his having once got her acquitted of a murder charge by cleverly contriving her sleeves at the trial to conceal her strength and by passing off the lacerations on the backs of her hands as the scratches of brambles rather than of human fingernails .It is the similarity between Estella's hands and Molly's ( `` The action of her fingers was like the action of knitting '' ) that provides Pip with a vital clue to the real identity of both and establishes a symbolic connection between the underworld of crime and the genteel cruelty of Satis House .Finally , Magwitch's pursuit of Compeyson , his archenemy and betrayer , begins by his holding him in a vicelike grip on the river flats to frustrate his escape and culminates in his `` laying his hand on his cloak to identify him '' , thus precipitating the death-locked struggle in the water during which Compeyson drowns .Magwitch's hand here ironically becomes the agent of justice .But only in one of its aspects is Great Expectations a tale of violence , revenge , and retribution .Money , so important a theme elsewhere in Dickens , is here central , and hands are often associated in some way with the false values -- acquisitiveness , snobbery , self-interest , hypocrisy , toadyism , irresponsibility , injustice -- that attach to a society based upon the pursuit of wealth .Dickens suggests the economic evils of such a society on the first page of his novel in the description of Pip's five little dead brothers `` who gave up trying to get a living exceedingly early in that universal struggle '' , who seemed to have `` all been born on their backs with their hands in their trousers-pockets , and had never taken them out in this state of existence '' .Pip's great expectations , his progress through illusion and disillusionment , turn , somewhat as they do for the naive hero of Dreiser's American Tragedy , upon the lure of genteel prosperity through unearned income -- what Wemmick calls `` portable property '' and what Jaggers reproaches Pip for letting `` slip through ( his ) fingers '' .Since a gentleman must , if possible , avoid sullying them by work , his hands , as importantly as his accent , become the index of social status .Almost the first step in the corruption of Pip's values is the unworthy shame he feels when Estella cruelly remarks the coarseness of his hands : `` They had never troubled me before , but they troubled me now , as vulgar appendages '' .Pip imagines how Estella would look down upon Joe's hands , roughened by work in the smithy , and the deliberate contrast between her white hands and his blackened ones is made to symbolize the opposition of values between which Pip struggles -- idleness and work , artificiality and naturalness , gentility and commonness , coldness and affection -- in fact , between Satis House and the forge .When the snobbery that alienates Pip from Joe finally gives way before the deeper and stronger force of love , the reunion is marked by an embarrassed handshake at which Pip exclaims : `` No , don't wipe it off -- for God's sake , give me your blackened hand '' ! !Pip's abject leave-taking of Miss Havisham , during which he kneels to kiss her hand , signalizes his homage to a supposed patroness who seems to be opening up for him a new world of glamour ; ;when , on the journey to London that immediately follows , he pauses nostalgically to lay his hand upon the finger-post at the end of the village , the wooden pointer symbolically designates a spiritual frontier between innocence and the corruption of worldly vanity .Incidentally , one cannot miss the significance of this gesture , for Dickens reintroduces it associatively in Pip's mind at another moral and psychological crisis -- his painful recognition , in a talk with Herbert Pocket , that his hopeless attachment to Estella is as self-destructive as it is romantic .In both cases the finger-post represents Pip's heightened awareness of contrary magnetisms .A variety of hand movements helps dramatize the moral climate of the fallen world Pip encounters beyond the forge .The vulture-like attendance of the Pocket family upon Miss Havisham is summed up in the hypocritical gestures of Miss Camilla Pocket , who puts her hand to her throat in a feigned spasm of grief-stricken choking , then lays it `` upon her heaving bosom '' with `` an unnatural fortitude of manner '' , and finally kisses it to Miss Havisham in a parody of the lady's own mannerism toward Estella .Pumblechook's hands throughout the novel serve to travesty greed and hypocritical self-aggrandizement .We first see him shaking Mrs. Joe's hand on discovering the sizable amount of the premium paid to her husband for Pip's indenture as an apprentice and later pumping Pip's hands `` for the hundredth time at least '' ( `` May I -- may I -- '' ? ?) in effusive congratulation to Pip on his expectations .We take leave of Pumblechook as he gloats over Pip's loss of fortune , extending his hand `` with a magnificently forgiving air '' and exhibiting `` the same fat five fingers '' , one of which he identifies with `` the finger of Providence '' and shakes at Pip in a canting imputation of the latter's `` ingratitoode '' and his own generosity as Pip's `` earliest benefactor '' .Pip first learns `` the stupendous power of money '' from the sycophantic tailor , Mr. Trabb , whose brutality to his boy helper exactly matches the financial resource of each new customer , and whose fawning hands touch `` the outside of each elbow '' and `` rub '' Pip out of the shop .The respectability which money confers implies a different etiquette , and , upon taking up the life of a London gentleman , Pip must learn from Herbert Pocket that `` the spoon is not generally used over-hand , but under '' .Surrounded by ancient elms , the campus is spacious and beautiful .The buildings are mostly Georgian .The Dartmouth student does not live in monastic seclusion , as he once did .But his is still a simple life relatively free of the female presence or influence , and he must go far , even though he may go fast , for sophisticated pleasures .He is still heir to the rare gifts of space and silence , if he chooses to be .He is by no means the country boy he might have been in the last century , down from the hills with bear grease on his hair and a zeal for book learning in his heart .The men's shops on Hanover's Main Street compare favorably with those in Princeton and New Haven .And the automobiles that stream out of Hanover each weekend , toward Smith and Wellesley and Mount Holyoke , are no less rakish than those leaving Cambridge or West Philadelphia .But there has always been an outdoor air to Dartmouth .The would-be sophisticate and the citybred youth adopt this air without embarrassment .No one here pokes fun at manly virtues .And this gives rise to an easy camaraderie probably unequaled elsewhere in the Ivy League .It even affects the faculty .Thus , when Dartmouth's Winter Carnival -- widely recognized as the greatest , wildest , roaringest college weekend anywhere , any time -- was broadcast over a national television hookup , Prexy John Sloan Dickey appeared on the screen in rugged winter garb , topped off by a tam-o'-shanter which he confessed had been acquired from a Smith girl .President Dickey's golden retriever , frolicking in the snow at his feet , added to the picture of masculine informality .This carefree disdain for `` side '' cropped up again in the same television broadcast .Dean Thaddeus Seymour , wearing ski clothes , was crowning a beauteous damsel queen of the Carnival .She must have looked temptingly pretty to the dean as he put the crown on her head .So he kissed her .No Dartmouth man was surprised .Dartmouth students enjoy other unusual diversions with equal sang-froid .For example , groups regularly canoe down the Connecticut River .This is in honor of John Ledyard , class of 1773 , who scooped a canoe out of a handy tree and first set the course way back in his own student days .And these hardy travelers are not unappreciated today .They are hailed by the nation's press , and Smith girls throng the riverbanks at Northampton and refresh the voyageurs with hot soup and kisses .Dartmouth's favorite and most characteristic recreation is skiing .Since the days when their two thousand pairs of skis outnumbered those assembled anywhere else in the United States , the students have stopped regarding the Olympic Ski Team as another name for their own .Yet Dartmouth still is the dominant member of the Intercollegiate Ski Union , which includes the winter sports colleges of Canada as well as those of this country .Dartmouth students ski everywhere in winter , starting with their own front door .They can hire a horse and go ski-joring behind him , or move out to Oak Hill , where there's a lift .The Dartmouth Skiway , at Holt's Ledge , ten miles north of the campus , has one of the best terrains in the East , ranging from novice to expert .Forty miles farther north is Mount Moosilauke , Dartmouth's own mountain .Here , at the Ravine Lodge , President Dickey acts as host every year to about a hundred freshmen who are being introduced by the Dartmouth Outing Club to life on the trails .The Lodge , built of hand-hewn virgin spruce , can handle fifty people for dining , sleeping , or lounging in its huge living room .The Outing Club also owns a chain of fourteen cabins and several shelters , extending from the Vermont hills , just across the river from the college , through Hanover to the College Grant -- 27,000 acres of wilderness 140 miles north up in the logging country .The cabins are equipped with bunks , blankets , and cooking equipment and are ideal bases for hikes and skiing trips .The club runs regular trips to the cabins , but many of the students prefer to take off in small unofficial groups for a weekend of hunting , fishing , climbing , or skiing .Under the auspices of the Outing Club , Dartmouth also has the Mountaineering Club , which takes on tough climbs like Mount McKinley , and Bait & Bullet , whose interests are self-evident , and even sports a Woodman's Team , which competes with other New England colleges in wood sawing and chopping , canoe races , and the like .There is much to be said for a college that , while happily attuned to the sophisticated Ivies , still gives its students a chance to get up early in the morning and drive along back roads where a glimpse of small game , deer , or even bear is not uncommon .City boys find a lot of learning in the feel of an ax handle or in the sharp tang of a sawmill , come upon suddenly in a backwoods logging camp .And on the summit of Mount Washington , where thirty-five degrees below zero is commonplace and the wind velocity has registered higher than anywhere else in the world , there is a kind of wisdom to be found that other men often seek in the Himalayas `` because it is there '' .There is much to be said for such a college -- and Dartmouth men have been accused of saying it too often and too loudly .Their affection for their college home has even caused President Dickey to comment on this `` place loyalty '' as something rather specially Hanoverian .Probably a lawyer once said it best for all time in the Supreme Court of the United States .Early in the nineteenth century the State of New Hampshire was casting about for a way to found its own state university .It fixed on Dartmouth College , which was ready-made and just what the proctor ordered .The legislators decided to `` liberate '' Dartmouth and entered into a tug-o'-war with the college trustees over the control of classrooms , faculty , and chapel .For a time there were two factions on the campus fighting for possession of the student body .The struggle was resolved in 1819 in the Supreme Court in one of the most intriguing cases in our judicial history .In 1817 the lawyers were generally debating the legal inviolability of private contracts and charters .A lawyer , hired by the college , was arguing specifically for Dartmouth : Daniel Webster , class of 1801 , made her plight the dramatic focus of his whole plea .In an age of oratory , he was the king of orators , and both he himself and Chief Justice Marshall were bathed in manly tears , as Uncle Dan'l reached his thundering climax :`` It is , sir , as I have said , a small college , and yet there are those who love it .''Dartmouth is today still a small college -- and still a private one , thanks to Webster's eloquence .This is not out of keeping with its origins , probably the most humble of any in the Ivy group .Eleazar Wheelock , a Presbyterian minister , founded the school in 1769 , naming it after the second earl of Dartmouth , its sponsor and benefactor .Eleazar , pausing on the Hanover plain , found its great forests and remoteness good and with his own hands built the first College Hall , a log hut dedicated `` for the education & instruction of Youth of the Indian Tribes in this Land in reading , writing & all parts of learning which shall appear necessary and expedient for civilizing & christianizing Children of Pagans as well as in all liberal Arts and Sciences ; ;and also of English Youth and any others '' .It was a hardy undertaking , and Wheelock's was indeed `` a voice crying in the wilderness '' .A road had to be hacked through trackless forests between Hanover and Portsmouth to permit Governor Wentworth and a company of gentlemen to attend the first Dartmouth commencement in 1771 .The governor and his retinue thoughtfully brought with them a glorious silver punchbowl which is still one of the cherished possessions of the college .The exuberance on this occasion set a standard for subsequent Dartmouth gatherings .A student orator `` produced tears from a great number of the learned '' even before the punch was served .Then from the branches of a near-by tree an Indian underclassman , disdaining both the platform and the English language , harangued the assemblage in his aboriginal tongue .Governor Wentworth contributed an ox for a barbecue on the green beneath the three-hundred-foot pines , and a barrel of rum was broached .The cook got drunk , and President Wheelock proved to be a man of broad talents by carving the ox himself .Future commencements were more decorous perhaps , but the number of graduates increased from the original four at a relatively slow pace .By the end of the nineteenth century , in 1893 , when the Big Three , Columbia , and Penn were populous centers of learning , Dartmouth graduated only sixty-nine .The dormitories , including the beloved Dartmouth Hall , could barely house two hundred students in Spartan fashion .Then in 1893 Dr. William Jewett Tucker became president and the college's great awakening began .He transformed Dartmouth from a small New Hampshire institution into a national college .By 1907 the number of undergraduates had risen to 1,107 .And at his last commencement , in that year , Dr. Tucker and Dartmouth were honored by the presence of distinguished academic visitors attesting to the new stature of the college .The presidents of Cornell , Wisconsin , C.C.N.Y. , Bowdoin , Vermont , Brown , Columbia , Princeton , Yale , and Harvard and the presidents emeritus of Harvard and Michigan were there .Dartmouth is numerically still a small college today , with approximately twenty-nine hundred undergraduates .But it has achieved a cross-section of students from almost all the states , and two-thirds of its undergraduates come from outside New England .Over 450 different schools are usually represented in each entering class .Only a dozen or so schools send as many as six students , and there are seldom more than fifteen men in any single delegation .About two-thirds of the boys now come from public schools .It is still a college only and not a university ; ;it is , in fact , the only college in the Ivy group .However , three distinguished associated graduate schools offer professional curriculums -- the Dartmouth Medical School ( third oldest in the country and founded in 1797 ) , the Thayer School of Engineering , and the Amos Tuck School of Business Administration .All three are purposely kept small , with a current total enrollment of about two hundred .All three schools coordinate their educational programs with that of the undergraduate college and , like the college proper , place emphasis upon a broad liberal arts course as the proper foundation for specialized study .Students of the college who are candidates for the A.B. degree and can satisfy the academic requirements of the medical and business schools , may enter either of these associated schools at the beginning of senior year , thus completing the two-year postgraduate course in one year .The Thayer School offers a year of postgraduate study in somewhat the same way , after a boy wins a B.S. in engineering .So Dartmouth is moving closer to the others in the Ivy group .It is still , however , the junior member of the League , if not in years at least in the catching up it has had to do .It has not been a well-known school for any part of the span the other Ivies have enjoyed .However much football has been over-emphasized , the public likes to measure its collegiate favorites by the scoreboard , so , while Yale need never give its record a thought again since outscoring its opponents 694 to 0 in the season of 1888 , Dartmouth had to wait until its championship team of 1925 for national recognition .It has come on with a rush in more significant areas .Today it espouses certain ideas in its curriculum that other institutions might consider somewhat breathtaking .But Dartmouth preserves its youthful brashness even in its educational attitudes , and , although some of its experiments may still be in the testing stage , they make for lively copy .President Emeritus Hopkins once proposed to corral an `` aristocracy of brains '' in Hanover .If the content of faith is to be presented today in a form that can be `` understanded of the people '' -- and this , it must not be forgotten , is one of the goals of the perennial theological task -- there is no other choice but to abandon completely a mythological manner of representation .This does not mean that mythological language as such can no longer be used in theology and preaching .The absurd notion that demythologization entails the expurgation of all mythological concepts completely misrepresents Bultmann's intention .His point is not that mythology may not be used , but that it may no longer be regarded as the only or even the most appropriate conceptuality for expressing the Christian kerygma .When we say that a mythological mode of thought must be completely abandoned , we mean it must be abandoned as the sole or proper means for presenting the Christian understanding of existence .Mythological concepts may by all means still be used , but they can be used responsibly only as `` symbols '' or `` ciphers '' , that is , only if they are also constantly interpreted in nonmythological ( or existential ) terms .The statement is often made that when Bultmann argues in this way , he `` overestimates the intellectual stumbling-block which myth is supposed to put in the way of accepting the Christian faith '' .But this statement is completely unconvincing .If Bultmann's own definition of myth is strictly adhered to ( and it is interesting that this is almost never done by those who make such pronouncements ) , the evidence is overwhelming that he does not at all exaggerate the extent to which the mythological concepts of traditional theology have become incredible and irrelevant .Nor is it necessary to look for such evidence in the great urban centers of our culture that are admittedly almost entirely secularized and so profoundly estranged from the conventional forms in which the gospel has been communicated .On the contrary , even in the heart of `` the Bible belt '' itself , as can be attested by any one who is called to work there , the industrial and technological revolutions have long been under way , together with the corresponding changes in man's picture of himself and his world .In fact , it is in just such a situation that the profundity of Bultmann's argument is disclosed .Although the theological forms of the past continue to exist in a way they do not in a more secularized situation , the striking thing is the rapidity with which they are being reduced to a marginal existence .This is especially in evidence among the present generation of the suburban middle class .Time and again in counseling and teaching , one encounters members of this group whose attempts to bring into some kind of unity the insubstantial mythologies of their `` fundamentalist '' heritage and the stubborn reality of the modern world are only too painfully obvious .The same thing is also evidenced by the extreme `` culture-Protestantism '' so often observed to characterize the preaching and teaching of the American churches .In the absence of a truly adequate conceptuality in which the gospel can be expressed , the unavoidable need to demythologize it makes use of whatever resources are at hand -- and this usually means one or another of the various forms of `` folk religion '' current in the situation .This is not to say that the only explanation of the present infatuation with Norman Vincent Peale's `` cult of reassurance '' or the other types of a purely cultural Christianity is the ever-present need for a demythologized gospel .But it is to say that this need is far more important for such infatuation than most of the pundits seem to have suspected .However , even if the latent demand for demythologization is not nearly as widespread as we are claiming , at least among the cultured elements of the population there tends to be an almost complete indifference to the church and its traditional message of sin and grace .To be sure , when this is pointed out , a common response among certain churchmen is to fulminate about `` the little flock '' and `` the great crowd '' and to take solace from Paul's castigation of the `` wisdom of the wise '' in the opening chapter of First Corinthians .But can we any longer afford the luxury of such smug indigation ? ?Can the church risk assuming that the `` folly '' of men is as dear to God as their `` wisdom '' , or , as is also commonly implied , that `` the foolishness of God '' and `` the foolishness of men '' are simply two ways of talking about the same thing ? ?Can we continue to alienate precisely those whose gifts we so desperately need and apart from whose co-operation our mission in the world must become increasingly precarious ? ?There is an ancient and venerable tradition in the church ( which derives , however , from the heritage of the Greeks rather than from the Bible ) that God is completely independent of his creation and so has no need of men for accomplishing his work in the world .By analogy , the church also has been regarded as entirely independent of the `` world '' in the sense of requiring nothing from it in order to be the church .But , as Scripture everywhere reminds us , God does have need of his creatures , and the church , a fortiori , can ill afford to do without the talents with which the world , by God's providence , presents it .And yet this is exactly the risk we run when we assume , as we too often do , that we can continue to preach the gospel in a form that makes it seem incredible and irrelevant to cultured men .Until we translate this gospel into a language that enlightened men today can understand , we are depriving ourselves of the very resources on which the continued success of our witness most certainly depends .In arguing in this way , we are obviously taking for granted that a demythologized restatement of the kerygma can be achieved ; ;and that we firmly believe this will presently become evident when we set forth reasons to justify such a conviction .But the main point here is that even if such a restatement were not possible , the demand to demythologize the kerygma would still be unavoidable .This is what we mean when we say this demand must be accepted without condition .If to be a Christian means to say yes where I otherwise say no , or where I do not have the right to say anything at all , then my only choice is to refuse to be a Christian .Expressed differently : if the price for becoming a faithful follower of Jesus Christ is some form of self-destruction , whether of the body or of the mind -- sacrificium corporis , sacrificium intellectus -- then there is no alternative but that the price remain unpaid .This must be stressed because it is absolutely essential to the argument of this concluding chapter .Modern man , as Dietrich Bonhoeffer has told us , has `` come of age '' ; ;and though this process by no means represents an unambiguous gain and is , in fact , marked by the estrangement from the depths that seems to be the cost of human maturation , it is still a positive step forward ; ;and those of us who so richly benefit from it should be the last to despise it .In any event , it is an irreversible step , and if we are at all honest with ourselves , we will know we have no other alternative than to live in the world in which God has seen fit to place us .To say this , of course , is to take up a position on one side of a controversy going on now for some two hundred years , or , at any rate , since the beginning of the distinctively modern period in theological thought .We have aligned ourselves with that `` liberal '' tradition in Protestant Christianity that counts among the great names in its history those of Schleiermacher , Ritschl , Herrmann , Harnack , and Troeltsch , and more recently , Schweitzer and the early Barth and , in part at least , Bultmann .It is to this same tradition that most of the creative figures in the last century and a half of American theology also belong .For we must number here not only the names of Bushnell , Clarke , and Rauschenbusch , not to mention those of `` the Chicago School '' and Macintosh , but those of the brothers Niebuhr and ( if America may claim him ! !) Tillich as well .Finally , we may also mention the several members of the self-consciously `` neoliberal '' movement that developed at the University of Chicago and is heavily indebted philosophically to the creative work of Alfred North Whitehead .What makes this long and diverse tradition essentially one is that those who have belonged to it have been profoundly in earnest about being modern men in a distinctively modern world .Although they have also been concerned to stand squarely within the tradition of the apostolic church , they have exhibited no willingness whatever to sacrifice their modernity to their Christianity .They have insisted , rather , on living fully and completely within modern culture and , so far from considering this treason to God , have looked upon it as the only way they could be faithful to him .When we say , then , that today , in our situation , the demand for demythologization must be accepted without condition , we are simply saying that at least this much of the liberal tradition is an enduring achievement .However much we may have to criticize liberal theology's constructive formulations , the theology we ourselves must strive to formulate can only go beyond liberalism , not behind it .In affirming this we have already taken the decisive step in breaking the deadlock into which Bultmann's attempt to formulate such a theology has led .For we have said , in effect , that of the two alternatives to his position variously represented by the other participants in the demythologizing discussion , only one is really an alternative .If the demand for demythologization is unavoidable and so must be accepted by theology unconditionally , the position of the `` right '' is clearly untenable .Whereas Bultmann's `` center '' position is structurally inconsistent and is therefore indefensible on formal grounds alone , the general position of the `` right '' , as represented , say , by Karl Barth , involves the rejection or at least qualification of the demand for demythologization and so is invalidated on the material grounds we have just considered .It follows , then , provided the possibilities have been exhausted , that the only real alternative is the general viewpoint of the `` left '' , which has been represented on the Continent by Fritz Buri and , to some extent at least , is found in much that is significant in American and English theology .In order to make the implications of our position as clear as possible , we may develop this argument at greater length .We may show , first , that there cannot possibly be an alternative other than the three typically represented by Bultmann , Barth , and Buri .To do this , it is sufficient to point out that if the principle in terms of which alternatives are to be conceived is such as to exclude more than two , then the question of a `` third '' possibility is a meaningless question .Thus , if what is at issue is whether `` All S is P '' , it is indifferent whether `` Some S is not P '' or `` No S is P '' , since in either case the judgment in question is false .Hence , if what is in question is whether in a given theology myth is or is not completely rejected , it is unimportant whether only a little bit of myth or a considerable quantity is accepted ; ;for , in either event , the first possibility is excluded .Therefore , the only conceivable alternatives are those represented , on the one hand , by the two at least apparently self-consistent but mutually exclusive positions of Buri and Barth and , on the other hand , by the third but really pseudo position ( analogous to a round square ) of Bultmann .A second point requires more extended comment .It will be recalled from the discussion in Section 7 that the position of the `` right '' , as represented by Barth , rests on the following thesis : The only tenable alternative to Bultmann's position is a theology that ( 1 ) rejects or at least qualifies his unconditioned demand for demythologization and existential interpretation ; ;( 2 ) accepts instead a special biblical hermeneutics or method of interpretation ; ;and ( 3 ) in so doing , frees itself to give appropriate emphasis to the event Jesus Christ by means of statements that , from Bultmann's point of view , are mythological .There were thirty-eight patients on the bus the morning I left for Hanover , most of them disturbed and hallucinating .An interne , a nurse and two attendants were in charge of us .I felt lonely and depressed as I stared out the bus window at Chicago's grim , dirty West Side .It seemed incredible , as I listened to the monotonous drone of voices and smelled the fetid odors coming from the patients , that technically I was a ward of the state of Illinois , going to a hospital for the mentally ill .I suddenly thought of Mary Jane Brennan , the way her pretty eyes could flash with anger , her quiet competence , the gentleness and sweetness that lay just beneath the surface of her defenses .We had become good friends during my stay at Cook County Hospital .I had told her enough about myself to offset somewhat the damaging stories that had appeared in local newspapers after my little adventure in Marshall Field & Co. .She knew that I lived at a good address on the Gold Coast , that I had once been a medical student and was thinking of returning to the university to finish my medical studies .She knew also that I was unmarried and without a single known relative .She wasn't quite sure that I felt enough remorse about my drinking , or that I would not return to it once I was out and on my own again .This had worried her .`` I read those newspaper stories about you '' , she had said .`` You must have loved that girl very much , but you couldn't have meant it when you said that you wanted to kill her '' .`` Why do you say that '' ? ?I asked .`` I was full of booze and , well , a drunk is apt to do anything he says he'll do '' .Nonsense ! !I grew up in an Irish neighborhood on Chicago's West Side .Don't tell me about drunks .You're not the kind to go violent .Were you in love with that girl '' ? ?`` Would it make any difference to you if I were , Mary Jane '' ? ?She met my eyes , suddenly angry .`` I wouldn't have gone into nursing if I didn't care about people .I'm interested in every patient I've helped take care of .When I think of people like you , well , I '' --`` You what , Mary Jane '' ? ?`` You are young , intelligent , have a whole lifetime before you to make something worth while of yourself , but you mess it up with whiskey , indifference , self-destructive attitudes .I don't blame that girl for breaking her engagement with you .Was she pretty '' ? ?`` Oh , yes '' , I said , feeling annoyed , `` she was very pretty .You don't believe that I'm going back to medical school and finish , do you '' ? ?`` Why should I ? ?I've worked this ward for three months now .We keep getting the same ones back again and again .They all mean well , have great promises to make when they are about to go home , but drinking is their sickness .You've not seemed like them , but maybe you are .You've treated your stay here like a big joke .It's not a joke to be sent to a place like this or to Hanover .I wanted to go to college , too '' --`` Why didn't you '' ? ?I asked .`` Chicago has some of the best '' --Her eyes flashed angrily .`` That's what I mean about you , Anderson '' , she said .`` You don't seem to know much about reality .I'll tell you why I didn't go to college ; ;I'm the oldest of six children .My father's a policeman and makes less than seven thousand dollars a year .There was no money for tuition , for clothes , for all the things you apparently take for granted .Nurses' training here doesn't cost anything .They even pay me six dollars a month .I think it's a good deal .I'm going to become a good nurse , and I've got two baby brothers that are going to have college if I have to work at my profession until I'm an old maid to give it to them '' .`` Do you have a boy friend '' ? ?I asked .`` That's none of your business '' , she said , then changed the subject .`` What about your father and mother , don't you think of them when you're in a place like this '' ? ?`` My father and mother died when I was two years old '' , I said .`` My aunt raised me .Aunt Mary died when I was doing my military service .I have no one but myself to worry about '' .Something in my voice must have touched her deeply because her anger passed quickly , and she turned away to keep me from seeing her face .`` I'm sorry '' , she said .`` I don't know what I'd do without my family .We've always been so close '' .`` Tell me more about them '' .Her eyes became bright as she talked about her father and mother , aunts and uncles , cousins .Listening , I felt cheated and lonely as only an orphan can .When she had finished I said :`` Your dad sounds like a good father and a good policeman .I'll bet he wouldn't be pleased if a rumdum like me were to ask his daughter for a date -- I mean , after I'm out of the hospital , a month or so from now '' .`` My father is a sergeant of detectives and has been attached to Homicide for five years .He's a pretty good judge of character , Anderson .I don't think he'd mind too much if he were sure you'd decided not to be a rumdum in the future '' .`` What about you ? ?How would you feel about it if I were to ask you for a date when I get through at Hanover '' ? ?`` If I thought you were serious about going back to school , that you'd learned something from your experiences here and at Hanover -- well , I might consider such an offer .What about your that girl you were going to kill '' ? ?It suddenly seemed very important to me that Mary Jane Brennan should know the truth about me -- that I was not the confused , sick , irresponsible person she believed me to be .`` There are things about me that I can't tell you now , Mary Jane '' , I said , `` but if you'll go out to dinner with me when I get out of Hanover , I'd like to tell you the whole story .I can say this : I'm dead serious about going back to school .As for that other girl , let's just say that I never want to see her again .You will get to come home on long weekends from Hanover , won't you '' ? ?`` Yes , I'll get one overnight a month '' .`` We'll go up to the Edgewater Beach Hotel for dinner '' , I said .`` Do you like to dance ? ?They always have a good orchestra '' .`` I like to dance '' , she said , then turned and walked away .There hadn't been anything really personal in her interest in me .I knew that .It was just that she felt deeply about every patient on the ward and wanted to believe that they might benefit from their treatment there .Now , riding this hospital bus , feeling isolated and utterly alone , I knew that she was genuine and unique , quite unlike any girl I had known before .It seemed the most important thing in my life at this moment that she should know the real truth about me .It was a fantastic story .Only two people in the state of Illinois knew that I was entering Hanover State Hospital under an assumed name , or why .It was unlikely that any girl as sharp as Mary Jane Brennan would believe it without proof .But I had the proof , all documented in a legal agreement which I would show her the moment I was free to do so .As the bus turned into the main highway and headed toward Hanover I settled back in my seat and closed my eyes , thinking over the events of the past two weeks , trying to put the pieces in order .I wondered suddenly as I listened to the disconnected jabberings coming from the patient behind me , if I had not perhaps imagined it all .Perhaps this was reality and Dale Nelson , the actor , was delusion ; ;a figment of Carl Anderson's imagination .FourI had come to Chicago from New York early in September with a dramatic production called Ask Tony .It was a bad play , real grade-A turkey , which only a prevalence of angels with grandiose dreams of capital gain and tax money to burn could have put into rehearsal .No one , not even the producer , had any real hope of getting it back to Broadway .But because it was a suspense gangster story of the Capone era , many of us felt that it might catch on for a run in Chicago , continue as a road company , and eventually become a movie .Such optimism was completely unjustified .The critics literally screamed their indignation .Ask Tony was doomed from the moment Kupcinet leveled on it in his Sun-Times column .We opened on Friday and closed the following Monday .Out of the entire cast I alone received good notices for my portrayal of a psychopathic killer .This let me in for a lot of kidding from the rest of the company , two members of which were native Chicagoans .We were paid off Tuesday morning and given tickets back to New York .I felt lonely and depressed as I packed my bags at the Croydon Hotel .It seemed to me that my life was destined to be one brilliant failure after another .I had been among the top third in my class at N.Y.U. , had wanted desperately to go to medical school , but I'd run out of money and energy at the same time .Then later I had quit my safe , secure five-a-week spot on a network soap opera to take a part in this play .It seemed to me that I was not only unlucky but quite stupid as well .I knew that I'd soon be back working as an orderly at the hospital or as a counterman at Union News or Schraffts while waiting for another acting job to open .It suddenly occurred to me that I did not particularly like acting , that I was at some sort of crossroads and would have to decide soon what I was going to do with my life .I closed the last bag and stood all three at the door for the bellboy to pick up , then went to the bathroom for a drink of water .The telephone rang .When I answered it a voice too dignified and British to be real said , `` Is this Mr. Dale Nelson , the actor '' ? ?`` All right '' , I said .`` Why don't you bastards lay off for a while '' ? ?`` I beg your pardon , sir '' ? ?`` All right .This is Dale Nelson the actor '' .`` Good .I'm calling you , Mr. Nelson , at the request of Mr. Phillip Wycoff .Could you possibly have lunch with him today ? ?His car could pick you up at your hotel at twelve '' .I smiled .`` You'll send the Rolls-Royce , of course '' ? ?`` Yes , of course , Mr. Nelson '' .I started to say something else appropriate , but the man had hung up .I finally went downstairs to the bar off the main lobby where most of the cast were drowning their sorrows over the untimely passing of Ask Tony .They all bowed low as I approached them .`` All right , you bastards '' , I said , `` the great actor is about to buy a drink '' .I laid a tenspot on the bar and motioned to the bartender to serve a round .He had just returned my change when the doorman came in off the street to page me .I walked over to him .`` You Mr. Nelson '' ? ?He asked .`` That's right '' .`` Mr. Wycoff's car is waiting for you at the east entrance '' .I followed him out through the lobby to the street .An ancient Rolls-Royce , as shiningly impressive as the day it came off the ship , was parked at the curb .The elderly chauffeur , immaculate in a dark uniform , stood stiffly at attention holding open the door of the town car .Some who have written on Utopia have treated it as `` a learned diversion of a learned world '' , `` a phantasy with which More amused himself '' , `` a holiday work , a spontaneous overflow of intellectual high spirits , a revel of debate , paradox , comedy and invention '' .With respect to this view , two points are worth making .First , it appears to be based on the fact that on its title page Utopia is described as `` festivus '' , `` gay '' .It overlooks the other fact that it is described as `` Nec minus salutaris quam festivus '' , `` no less salutary than gay '' .It also overlooks the fact that in a rational lexicon , and quite clearly in More's lexicon , the opposite of serious is not gay but frivolous , and the opposite of gay is not serious but solemn .More believed that a man could be both serious and gay .That a writer who is gay cannot be serious is a common professional illusion , sedulously fostered by all too many academics who mistakenly believe that their frivolous efforts should be taken seriously because they are expressed with that dreary solemnity which is the only mode of expression their authors are capable of .Secondly , to find a learned diversion and a pleasing joke in More's account of the stupid brutalities of early sixteenth century wars , of the anguish of the poor and dispossessed , of the insolence and cruelty of the rich and powerful requires a callousness toward suffering and sin that would be surprising in a moral imbecile and most surprising in More himself .Indeed , it is even surprising in the Canon of Christ Church and Regius Professor of Ecclesiastical History , who fathered this most peculiar view , and in the brilliant Professor of Medieval and Renaissance English at Cambridge , who inherited it and is now its most eminent proponent .But to return to the main line of our inquiry , it is doubtful that Utopia is still widely read because More was medieval or even because he was a martyr -- indeed , it is likely that these days many who read Utopia with interest do not even know that its author was a martyr .Utopia is still widely read because in a sense More stood on the margin of modernity .And if he did stand on the margins of modernity , it was not in dying a martyr for such unity as Papal supremacy might be able to force on Western Christendom .It was not even in writing Latin epigrams , sometimes bawdy ones , or in translating Lucian from Greek into Latin or in defending the study of Greek against the attack of conservative academics , or in attacking the conservative theologians who opposed Erasmus's philological study of the New Testament .Similar literary exercises were the common doings of a Christian humanist of the first two decades of the sixteenth century .Had More's writings been wholly limited to such exercises , they would be almost as dimly remembered as those of a dozen or so other authors living in his time , whose works tenuously survive in the minds of the few hundred scholars who each decade in pursuit of their very specialized occasions read those works .More stands on the margins of modernity for one reason alone -- because he wrote Utopia .And the evidence that he does , indeed , stand there derives quite simply from the vigorous interest with which rather casual readers have responded to that book for the past century or so .Only one other contemporary of More's evokes so immediate and direct a response , and only one other contemporary work -- Niccolo Machiavelli and The Prince .Can we discover what it is in Utopia that has evoked this response ? ?Remember that in seeking the modern in Utopia we do not deny the existence of the medieval and the Renaissance there ; ;we do not even need to commit ourselves to assessing on the same inconceivable scale the relative importance of the medieval , the Renaissance , and the modern .The medieval was the most important to Chambers because he sought to place Thomas More , the author of Utopia , in some intelligible relation with St. Thomas More , the martyr .To others whose concern it is to penetrate the significance of Christian Humanism , the Renaissance elements are of primary concern .But here we have a distinctly modern preoccupation ; ;we want to know why that book has kept on selling the way it has ; ;we want to know what is perennially new about Utopia .What is new about it ? ?To that question the answer is simple ; ;it can be made in two words , Utopian communism .But it is an answer which opens the door wide to an onrush of objections and denials .Surely there is nothing new about communism .We find it in Plato's Republic , and in Utopia More acknowledges his debt to that book .We find it in that `` common way of life pleasing to Christ and still in use among the truest societies of Christians '' , that is , the better monasteries which made it easier to convert the Utopians to Christianity .We find it in the later Stoic conception of man's natural condition which included the community of all possessions .This conception was taken up by the early Church Fathers and by canon lawyers and theologians in the Middle Ages ; ;and More was far too well read not to have come across it in one or several of the forms thus given it .But although the idea of communism is very old even in More's day and did not spring full-clad from his imagination in 1515 , it is not communism as such that we are concerned with .We are concerned not with the genus communism nor with other species of the genus : Platonic , Stoic , early Christian , monastic , canonist or theological communism ; ;we are concerned with Utopian communism -- that is , simply communism as it appears in the imaginary commonwealth of Utopia , as More conceived it .Perhaps one way to sharpen our sense of the modernity of Utopian communism is to contrast it with the principal earlier types of communistic theory .We will achieve a more vivid sense of what it is by realizing what it is not .In Plato's Republic communism is -- to speak anachronistically -- a communism of Janissaries .Its function is to separate from the base ruled mass , among whom private ownership prevails , the governing warrior elite .Moreover , it is too readily forgotten that in the Republic what gave the initial impetus to Plato's excursus into the construction of an imaginary commonwealth with its ruling-class communism of goods , wives , and children , was his quest for a canon for the proper ordering of the individual human psyche ; ;and it is to this problem that the Republic ultimately returns .In More's Utopia communism is not a means of separating out a warrior elite from the lumpish mass .Utopian communism applies to all Utopians .And in the economy of the book it is not peripheral but central .The concern of Utopia is with the optimo reipublicae statu , the best ordering of a civil society ; ;and it is again and again made clear that Utopian communism provides the institutional array indispensible to that best ordering .To derive Utopian communism from the Jerusalem Christian community of the apostolic age or from its medieval successors-in-spirit , the monastic communities , is with an appropriate shift of adjectives , misleading in the same way as to derive it from Plato's Republic : in the Republic we have to do with an elite of physical and intellectual athletes , in the apostolic and monastic communities with an elite of spiritual and religious athletes .The apostolic community was literally an elite : chosen by Christ himself .And the monastic communities were supposed to be made up of volunteers selected only after a novitiate which would test their religious aptitude for monastic rigors , their spiritual athleticism .Finally , the conception of the natural community of all possessions which originated with the Stoics was firmly fixed in a tradition by More's time , although it was not accepted by all the theologian-philosophers of the Middle Ages .In that tradition communism lay a safe distance back in the age of innocence before the Fall of Man .It did not serve to contrast the existing order of society with a possible alternative order , because the age of innocence was not a possible alternative once man had sinned .The actual function of patristic communism was adequately set forth by St. Gregory almost a millenium before More wrote Utopia .`` The soil is common to all men .When we give the necessities of life to the poor , we restore to them what is already theirs .We should think of it more as an act of justice than compassion '' .Because community not severalty of property is the law of nature no man can assert an absolutely unalterable right to what is his .Indeed , of all that is his every man is by nature and reason and therefore by conscience obligated to regard himself as a custodian .He is a trustee for the common good , however feeble the safeguards which the positive or municipal law of property provides against his misuse of that share of the common fund , wisely or unwisely , entrusted to his keeping .In contrast to this Stoic-patristic view , Utopia implies that the nature of man is such that to rely on individual conscience to supply the deficiencies of municipal law is to embark on the bottomless sea of human sinfulness in a sieve .The Utopians brace conscience with legal sanctions .In a properly ordered society the massive force of public law performs the function which in natural law theory ineptly is left altogether to a small voice so often still .In all the respects just indicated Utopian communism differs from previous conceptions in which community of possessions and living plays a role .Neither from one of these conceptions nor from a combination of them can it be deduced .We do not deny originality to the Agamemnon because Aeschylus found the tales of the house of Atreus among the folk lore of the Greeks .In a like sense whatever bits or shreds of previous conceptions one may find in it , Utopian communism remains , as an integral whole , original -- a new thing .It is not merely a new thing ; ;it is one of the very few new things in Utopia ; ;most of the rest is medieval or humanist or part of an old tradition of social criticism .But to say that at a moment in history something is new is not necessarily to say that it is modern ; ;and for this statement the best evidence comes within the five years following the publication of Utopia , when Martin Luther elaborates a new perception of the nature of the Divine's encounter with man .New , indeed , is Luther's perception , but not modern , as anyone knows who has ever tried to make intelligible to modern students what Luther was getting at .Although Utopian communism is both new in 1516 and also modern , it is not modern communism or even modern socialism , as they exist or have ever existed in theory or in practice .Consider the features of Utopian communism : generous public provision for the infirm ; ;democratic and secret elections of all officers including priests , meals taken publicly in common refectories ; ;a common habit or uniform prescribed for all citizens ; ;even houses changed once a decade ; ;six hours of manual labor a day for all but a handful of magistrates and scholars , and careful measures to prevent anyone from shirking ; ;no private property , no money ; ;no sort of pricing at all for any goods or services , and therefore no market in the economic sense of the term .Whatever the merits of its intent , Utopian communism is far too naive , far too crude , to suit any modern socialist or communist .It is not the details of Utopian communism that make Utopia modern , it is the spirit , the attitude of mind that informs those details .What that spirit and attitude were we can best understand if we see more precisely how it contrasts with the communist tradition with the longest continuous history , the one which reached Christianity by the way of Stoicism through the Church Fathers of Late Antiquity .Are you retiring now ? ?If so , are you saying , `` Where did the last few years go ? ?How did I get to be sixty-five so fast ? ?What do I do now '' ? ?Yes , retirement seems to creep upon you suddenly .Somehow we old-timers never figured we would ever retire .We always thought we would die with our boots on .Out of the blue comes talk of pension plans .Compulsory retirement at sixty-five looms on our horizon .Still , it seems in the far future .Suddenly , one day , up it pops ! !Sixty-five years and you've had it ! !So , now what ? ?Oh sure ! !You've thought about it before in a hazy sort of way .But ! !It never seemed real ; ;never seemed as if it could happen to you ; ;only to the other fellow .Now ! !Here it is ! !How am I going to live ? ?What am I going to do ? ?Where do I go from here ? ?A great many retired people are the so-called white collar workers .Are you one of these ? ?If so , you are of the old school .You are conscientious , hard working , honest , accurate , a good penman , and a stickler for a job well done , with no loose ends .Everything must balance to the last penny .Also you can spell , without consulting a dictionary for every other word .You never are late for work and seldom absent .Actually , you can take no special credit for this .It is the way you were taught and your way of life .All this is standard equipment for a man of your day ; ;your stock in trade ; ;your livelihood .However , the last few years of your life , things seem to be changing .Your way doesn't seem to be so darned important any more .You realize you are getting in the old fogy class .To put it bluntly , you are getting out-moded .What's happened ? ?The answer is a new era .Now , looming on the horizon are such things as estimated totals , calculated risks and I.B.M. machines .The Planning Dept. comes into existence .All sorts of plans come to life .This is followed by a boom in conferences .Yes sir ! !Conferences become very popular .When a plan burst its seams , hasty conferences supply the necessary patch , and life goes merrily on .That's called progress ! !The new way of life ! !Let's face it ! !You had your day and it was a good day .Let this generation have theirs .Time marches on ! !Well , to get back to the problem of retirement .Every retiring person has a different situation facing him .Some have plenty of money -- some have very little money .Some are blest with an abundance of good health -- some are in poor health and many are invalids .Some have lovely homes -- some live in small apartments .Some have beautiful gardens -- some not even a blade of grass .Some have serenity of mind , the ability to accept what they have , and make the most of it ( a wonderful gift to have , believe me ) -- some see only darkness , the bitter side of everything .Well , whatever you have , that's it ! !You've got to learn to live with it .Now ! !The question is `` How are you going to live with it '' ? ?You can sit back and moan and bewail your lot .Yes ! !You can do this .But , if you do , your life will be just one thing -- unhappiness -- complete and unabridged .It seems to me , the first thing you've got to do , to be happy , is to face up to your problems , no matter what they may be .Make up your mind to pool your resources and get the most out of your remaining years of life .One thing , I am sure of , you must get an interest in life .You've got to do something .Many of you will say , `` Well , what can I do '' ? ?Believe me ! !There are many , many things to do .Find out what you like to do most and really give it a whirl .If you can't think of a thing to do , try something -- anything .Maybe you will surprise yourself .True ! !We are not all great artists .I , frankly , can't draw a straight line .Maybe you are not that gifted either , but how about puttering around with the old paints ? ?You may amaze yourself and acquire a real knack for it .Anyway , I'll bet you have a lot of fun .Do you like to sew ? ?Does making your own clothes or even doll clothes , interest you ? ?Do you love to run up a hem , sew on buttons , make neat buttonholes ? ?If you do , go to it .There is always a market for this line of work .Some women can sit and sew , crochet , tat or knit by the hour , and look calm and relaxed and turn out beautiful work .Where sewing is concerned , I'm a total loss .When you see a needle in my hands you will know the family buttons have fallen off and I have to sew them back on , or get out the safety pins .Then again , there's always that lovely old pastime of hooking or braiding rugs .Not for me , but perhaps just the thing for you .Well ! !How's about mosaic tile , ceramics or similar arts and crafts ? ?Some people love to crack tile and it's amazing what beautiful designs they come up with as a result of their cracking good time .How about the art of cooking ? ?Do you yearn to make cakes and pies , or special cookies and candies ? ?There is always an open market for this sort of delicacy , in spite of low calorie diets , cottage cheese and hands-off-all-sweets to the contrary .Some people can carve most anything out of a piece of wood .Some make beautiful chairs , cabinets , chests , doll houses , etc. .Perhaps you couldn't do that but have you ever tried to see what you could do with a hunk of wood ? ?Outside of cutting your fingers , maybe you would come up with nothing at all , but then again , you might turn out some dandy little gadgets .Some women get a real thrill out of housework .They love to dust , scrub , polish , wax floors , move the furniture around from place to place , take down the curtains , put up new ones and have themselves a real ball .Maybe that's your forte .It certainly isn't mine .I can look at furniture in one spot year in and year out and really feel for sure that's where it belongs .Perhaps you would like to become a writer .This gives you a wide and varied choice .Will it be short stories , fiction , nonfiction , biography , poetry , children's stories , or even a book if you are really ambitious ? ?Ever since I was a child , I have always had a yen to try my hand at writing .If you do decide to write , you will soon become acquainted with rejection slips and dejection .Don't be discouraged ! !This is just being a normal writer .Just let the rejection slips fall where they may , and keep on plugging , and finally you will make the grade .Few new writers have their first story accepted , so they tell me .But , it could happen , and it may happen to you .Then there's always hobbies , collecting stamps , coins , timetables , salt and pepper shakers , elephants , dogs , dolls , shells , or shall we just say collecting anything your heart desires ? ?I can hear some of you folks protesting .You say , `` But it costs a lot of money to have a hobby .I haven't got that kind of money '' .True ! !It does cost a lot of money for most hobbies but there are hobbies that are for free .How about a rock collection , or a collection of leaves from different trees or shrubs and in different colors ? ?Then , take flowers .They are many and varied .Also , there's scrap books , collecting newspaper pictures and clippings , or any items of interest to you .It's getting interested in something that counts .As for me , I am holding in reserve two huge puzzles ( I love puzzles ) to put together when time hangs heavy on my hands .So far , the covers have never been off the boxes .I just don't have time to do half the things I want to do now .So in closing , fellow retired members , I advise you to make the most of each day , enjoy each one to the n'th degree .Travel , if you can .Keep occupied to the point you are not bored with life and you will truly find these final days and years of your lives to be sunshine sweet .Good Luck ! !To one and all -- Good Days ahead ! !An important criterion of maturity is creativity .The mature person is creative .What does it mean to be creative , a term we hear with increasing frequency these days ? ?When we turn to Noah Webster we find him helpful as usual .`` To be creative is to have the ability to cause to exist -- to produce where nothing was before -- to bring forth an original production of human intelligence or power '' .We are creative , it seems , when we produce something which has not previously existed .Thus creativity may run all the way from making a cake , building a chicken coop , or producing a book , to founding a business , creating a League of Nations or , developing a mature character .All living creatures from the lowest form of insect or animal life evidence the power of creativity , if it is only to reproduce a form like their own .While man shares this procreative function with all his predecessors in the evolutionary process , he is the only animal with a true non-instinctive and conscious creative ability .An animal , bird or insect creates either a burrow , or nest or hive in unending sameness according to specie .Man's great superiority over these evolutionary forbears is in the development of his imagination .This gives him the power to form in his mind new image combinations of old memories , ideas and experiences and to project them outside of himself into his environment in new and ever-changing forms .It has been truly said that anything man can imagine he can produce or create by projecting this inner image into its counterpart in the objective world .In our own time we have seen the most fantastic imagery of a Jules Verne come into actuality .The vision of a Lord Tennyson expressed in a poem 100 years ago took visible form over London in the air blitzes of 1941 .In fact all of our civilized world is the resultant of man's projection of his imagination over the past 60 centuries or more .It is in this one aspect , at least , that man seems to be made in the image of his Creator .Not only can man project his imagination out into his environment in concrete forms , but even more importantly , he can turn it inward to help create new and better forms of himself .We recognize that young people through imaginative mind and body training can become athletes , acrobats , dancers , musicians and artists , developing many potentialities .We know that actors can learn to portray a wide variety of character roles .By this same combination of the will and the imagination , each one of us can learn to portray permanently the kind of character we would like to be .We must realize with Prof. Charles Morris in his The Open Self that `` Man is the being that can continually remake himself , the artisan that is himself the material for his own creation '' .So far in history man has been too greatly over-occupied with projecting things into his environment rather than first creating the sort of person who can make the highest use of the things he has created .Is not the present world crisis a race between things we have created which can now destroy us and between populations of sufficient wisdom and character to forestall the tragedy .Is it not the obligation of us older citizens to lend our weight to being creative on the character side and to hasten our own maturing process ? ?Sir Julian Huxley in his book Uniqueness Of Man makes the novel point that just as man is unique in being the only animal which requires a long period of infancy and childhood under family protection , so is he the only animal who has a long period after the decline of his procreativity .`` Well '' -- said Mr. Skyros .`` I take a little time to think it over '' .It was awkward : very awkward .There would be all the nuisance of contacting someone else to take over .Someone reasonably trustworthy .And Angie would hear about it .And Angie knew --`` Time '' , said Angie , and he smiled very sweet and slow at Mr. Skyros .`` Not too much time , because I'll be needing some more myself pretty much right away .And I done favors for you , big favor not so long back , didn't I , and I'm right here to take on where Pretty left off .No trouble .I don't want no trouble , you don't want no trouble , nobody wants trouble , Mr. Skyros '' .Dear heaven , no , thought Mr. Skyros , turning away as another man came in .He straightened his tie at the mirror with a shaking hand ; ;the genial smile seemed painted on his face .Angie knew -- Speak of dangerous information ! !Angie knew too much entirely already .Really he had Mr. Skyros at bay`` Big favor I done you .Acourse there's this deal o' Denny's -- and Jackie's -- kinda hangin' fire , ain't it , maybe you've been kinda worryin' over that .And can't say I blame you '' , said Angie thoughtfully .`` This deal with the ace o' spades .Anything to do with an ace o' spades , bad luck '' .Ace of spades -- a widow , that was what they called a widow , these low-class crooks remembered Mr. Skyros distractedly .All about that Angie knew , too .When things got a little out of hand , they very rapidly got a lot out of hand -- it seemed to be a general rule .All just by chance , and in a way tracing back to poor Frank , all of it , because naturally -- brothers , living together -- and Angie --Mr. Skyros did not at all like the look on Angelo's regular-featured , almost girlishly good-looking face -- or indeed anything about Angelo .Mr. Skyros was not a man who thought very much about moral principles ; ;he found money much more interesting ; ;but all the same he thought now , uneasily , of the way in which Angelo earned his living -- and paid for his own stuff -- and eyed the soft smile , and the spaniel-like dark eyes , and he felt a little ill .`` Look , my friend '' , he said , `` in my life I learn , how is it the proverb says , better an ounce of prevention to a pound of cure .I stay in business so long because I'm careful .Two weeks , a month , we talk it over again , and maybe if nothing happens meanwhile to say the cops know this and that , then we make a little deal , isn't it '' ? ?`` That's a long while '' , said Angie .`` I tell you , you want to leave it that way , I don't fool around with it .I go over to Castro and get fixed up there .I can't wait no two weeks '' .And Mr. Skyros didn't like Angie , but what with Prettyman and three of his boys inside , and not likely to come out -- And Angie such a valuable salesman , Prettyman said -- All the nuisance and danger of getting in touch with practically a whole new bunch of boys -- Why did everything have to happen at once ? ?Denny said stupidly , `` Why , you ain't turning Angie down , are you , Mr. Skyros ? ?I mean , we all figured -- I guess anybody'd figure -- Angie '' --Angelo gave him an affectionate smile .`` Mr. Skyros too smart a fellow want to get rid of me '' , he said .`` It's O.K. , Denny , everything's O.K. Ain't it , Mr. Skyros '' ? ?Oh , God , the name repeated over and over , anybody to hear -- Not being a fool , Mr. Skyros knew why .But aside from everything else , it would scarcely be pleasant to have dealings with one who was nominally an underling and actually held -- you could say -- the whip hand .And all because of Domokous ! !If Mr. Skyros had dreamed of all the trouble that young man would eventually cause --Of course , there was another factor .Angie worth his weight in gold right now , but these users , they sometimes went down fast .Who knew , Angie might not last long .The sweat broke out on Mr. Skyros' forehead as he realized he had been actually thinking -- hoping -- planning -- perhaps --Good God above , had not Domokous been enough ? ?He patted Angelo's thin shoulder paternally .`` Now you don't want to go talking that way '' , he said .`` Sure , sure , you're the one take over for Pretty , soon as I get the supply , get started up again , isn't it ? ?You don't need worry , Angelo .I tell you , I know how it is with you , my friend , I sympathize , and I'll make it a special point -- a special favor -- get in touch , and get some stuff just for you .I don't know if I can manage it tonight or tomorrow , but I'll try my best , my friend .You see , you got to remember , we all got schedules , like any business ! !My man , he won't be around a little while , he just fixed me up with this stuff they took out of the Elite .It's awkward , you see that , isn't it '' ? ?`` Well , that's your business , Mr. Skyros '' , said Angie , and his dreamy eyes moved past Mr. Skyros' shoulder to gaze vaguely out the ground-glass window .`` I appreciate it , you do that .Sure .We don't none of us want no trouble .I'm in a room over the Golden Club on San Pedro , you just ask for me there , you want see me .Or maybe I call you -- tonight ? ?About nine o'clock , I call and see if you got any .A couple decks for me , Mr. Skyros -- and ten-twelve to sell , see , I like to have a little ready cash '' .`` Oh , now , I don't know about that much '' , said Mr. Skyros .`` And you know , Angelo , Pretty , he always keeps it a strict cash basis , like they say '' --`` Sure '' , said Angie .`` Sure , Mr. Skyros .Fifty a throw , that the deal ? ?Sure .I bring you the cash , say five hundred for ten decks .Never mind how much I cut it , how much I get '' , and he smiled his sleepy smile again .`` Standard deal , Mr. Skyros .You go 'n' have a look round for it '' .`` I do my best '' , said Mr. Skyros earnestly , `` just for you , my friend .This is awkward for everybody , isn't it , we all got to put up with inconvenience sometimes .But I do my best for you '' .He got out of there in a hurry , brushing past another man in the door , mopping his brow .The expedient thing -- yes , very true , one must make do as one could , in some situations .It could all be straightened out later .Not very much later , but when things had settled down a little .After this deal with the Bouvardier woman went through .An ace of spades .He was not a superstitious man , but he felt perhaps there was a little something in that , indeed .He rather wished he had never got into the business , and still -- scarcely to be resisted , a nice little profit with not much work involved , easy moneyKatya Roslev , who would be Katharine Ross so very soon now , rang up her first sale of the day and counted back the change .She did not notice that the customer seized her purchase and turned away without a smile or a word of thanks .Usually she marked the few who did thank you , you didn't get that kind much in a place like this : and she played a little game with herself , seeing how downright rude she could act to the others , before they'd take offense , threaten to call the manager .Funny how seldom they did : used to it , probably .The kind who came into a cheap store like this ! !Grab , snatch , I saw that first ! !And , Here , I'll take this , I was before her , you wait on me now or I don't bother with it , see ! !This kind of placeShe'd be through here , just no time at all -- leave this kind of thing 'way behind .Off at noon , and she'd never come back .Never have to .Money -- a lot of money , enough .She'd be smart about it , get him to give it to her in little bills so's nobody would suspect -- maybe couldn't get it until Monday account of that , the banks -- But that wasn't really long to wait .Not when she'd waited so long already .No need say anything at all to the old woman .She had it all planned out , how she'd do .She'd say she didn't feel good on Sunday , couldn't go to church -- there'd be a little argument , but she could be stubborn -- and when the old woman had gone , quick pack the things she'd need to take , all but the dress she'd wear Monday , and take the bag down to that place in the station where you could put things in a locker overnight , for a dime .Then on Monday morning -- or it might have to be Tuesday -- get up and leave just the usual time , and last thing , put the money in an envelope under the old woman's purse there in the drawer .She wouldn't be going to get that for an hour or so after Katya had left , go do the daily shopping .No need leave a note with it , either -- or maybe just something like , Don't worry about me , I'm going away to make a better life .A better life .Escape .It wasn't as if she wanted much .She didn't mind working hard , not as if she figured to do anything wrong to live easy and soft -- all she wanted was a chance , where she wasn't marked as what she was .To be Katharine Ross , and work in a nicer shop somewhere , at a little more money so she could have prettier clothes , and learn ladies' manners and all like that , and get to know different people than up to now , not just the ones like her here , with foreign-sounding names , the ones went to the same church and -- Different place , different job , different people , she'd be all different too .Prettier , she'd do her hair another way ; ;smarter , and wear different kinds of clothes -- she'd be Katharine Ross , just what that sounded like .`` You've give me the wrong change '' , said the customer sharply .`` Think I can't count '' ? ?Katya made up the amount in indifferent silence .She was listening to other voices , out of the future .Some of those vaguely-imagined new , different people .Oh , Katharine's awfully nice , and pretty too , I like Katharine -- Let's ask Katharine to go with us , she's always lots of fun -- Katharine --Soon , very soon nowsixteenMendoza didn't wake until nearly nine-thirty .It was going to be another hot day ; ;already the thermometer stood close to ninety .Alison was still sound asleep ; ;he made fresh coffee and searched through all the desk drawers for more cigarettes before thinking of her handbag , and found a crumpled stray cigarette at its bottom , which tasted peculiarly of face powder .He left a note propped on the desk asking her to call him sometime today , and drove home .After he'd got out fresh liver for Bast , he paused to look at her crouched daintily over her dish .Surely she was just a trifle fatter around the middle ? ?He seemed to remember reading somewhere that Abyssinians had large litters , and suffered a dismaying vision of the apartment overrun with a dozen kittens .`` Y que sigue despues ? ?-- What then '' ? ?He asked her severely .`` A lot of people are so peculiar that they don't like cats , it's not the easiest thing in the world to find good homes for kittens -- and , damn it , you know very well if I have them around long , impossible to give them away ! !And I suppose now that you've finally grown up , if a little late , you'd go on producing kittens every six months or so .Yes , well , it's a pity to spoil your girlish figure -- which all those kittens would do anyway -- but I think when you've raised these we'll just have the vet fix it so there won't be any more .I wonder if the Carters would take one .And it's no good looking at me like that '' , as she wound affectionately around his ankles .Before losing itself in the sands of the 19th Century , the grand stream of Italian Renaissance architectural decoration made a last appearance in the Brumidi frescos of the Capitol Rotunda in Washington .The artistic generation after Brumidi was trained in the Paris of that time to a more meticulous standard of execution , and tended to overlook greatness of conception where faults and weakness were easy to find .But it is a great conception .The open ceiling , with allegorical and classical figures thrown in masses against the sky : the closed frieze , formally divided into historical scenes and tightly tied to the stone walls , belong in their large ordering to the line of Correggio and his Baroque followers .The descent may be remote , but this is surely the only full-scale example of that vigorous inheritance in the United States .Constantino Brumidi designed the decorative scheme as a whole , in collaboration with the architect Charles U. Walter , at the time when plans were being made to replace the wooden dome of Bullfinch with the present much larger iron structure .After many years and many interruptions he was able to finish the canopy fresco , and slightly less than half the frieze , beginning with the Liberty group opposite the East door , and ending with William Penn , all but one leg , when a tragic accident ended his career .He left at his death sketches , drawn to scale , for the rest of the circle .These were carried out not too faithfully by Filippo Costaggini , who began by supplying the missing member to the founder of Pennsylvania and noting in pencil , in Italian , that he `` began at this point '' .When Costaggini had used up all the sketches thirty-six feet of empty frieze were left over .A blank undecorated void , plastered in roughcast , disfigured the wall of the Rotunda until 1951 .Then , advised by the Architect of the Capitol , the Joint Committee for the Library , traditionally responsible for the works of art in the building , ordered the space cleared and painted in fresco , to show `` the Peace after the Civil War '' , `` the Spanish-American War '' , and `` the Birth of Aviation '' , to match as nearly as feasible Brumidi's technique and composition .Later the cleaning and restoration were ordered , first of the older part of the frieze , finally of the canopy .What follows is therefore a description of three separate undertakings , the new frescoing of the gap , and the successive essays in conservation , with some discussion of problems that arose in connection with each .For the use of students and future restorers , a full , day-by-day record was kept of all three undertakings , complete technical reports on what we found and what we did .These may be consulted in the office of the Architect of the Capitol , or the Library of Congress .The first preliminary was inspecting the unfinished length of frieze , a jumble of roughcast and finish coats , all in bad condition .It was decided to strip the whole area down to the bricks , and to replace the rough coats up to one inch thickness to agree with the older artists' preparation , with a mortar , one part slaked lime , three parts sand , to be put on in two layers .Cartoons were drawn full size , after sketches had been made to satisfy all the authorities .There was some difficulty here .One had to manage the given subjects , three diverse recent events , so as to make them part of a classical frieze , -- that is , a pattern of large figures filling the space , with not much else , against a blank background .Moreover , all three representations must be squeezed comfortably into little more than the length Brumidi allowed for each one of his .When it was all arranged to fit , and not to interrupt the lengthwise flow of movement in the frieze , the cartoons were tried in place .The scaffolding , a confusion of heavy beams hanging from the gallery above , was strong and safe , but obscured visibility .Nothing could be seen from the floor , but by moving around the gallery one could get glimpses ; ;and we were able to decide on some amplification of scale .To be sure of matching color as well as form , pieces of cartoon were traced on the roughcast , and large samples painted in fresco , then left two months to dry out to their final key .Later it was gratifying to note that they had set so solidly as to be hard to remove when the time came .The scaffold was the length of the space to be painted .What bits of Brumidi and Costaggini could be reached at either end seemed in good order , though the roughish sandy surface was thick with dust .Washed , they came out surprisingly clear and bright .It could be seen that both artists used a very thick final coat of plaster , one half inch , and that both followed the traditional Italian fresco technique as described by Cennino Cennini in the 14th Century , and current in Italy to this day .That is , they used opaque color throughout , getting solid highlights with active lime white .Painting `` a secco '' is much in evidence .A brown hatching reinforces and broadens shadows , and much of the background is solidly covered with a dark coat .This brown is sometimes so rich in medium as to appear to be oil paint .In our own practice , to have the last `` intonaco '' plaster coat thick enough to match , and at the same time to avoid fine cracks in drying , we found that it had to be put on in two layers , letting the first set awhile before applying the second .The mortar was three parts sand to two of lime .Some of the lime that is always on hand in the Capitol basement for plaster repairs was slaked several months for us ; ;but to make it stiffer , of a really putty-like consistency to avoid cracking , we added a little hydrated lime -- hard on the hands , but we could see no other disadvantage .I am told that a mortar longer slaked might have remained longer in condition for painting .As it was , it took the pigment well for six hours , enough for our purpose , and held it firmly in setting .It was obvious that to match Brumidi , white must be mixed with all but the darkest tones .Lime white , hard and brilliant , has a tendency to `` jump '' away from the other colors in drying , and also by its capacity to set , to preclude the use of ready-made gradations , so useful in decorative work .In older Italian practice , lime , dried and reground `` bianco sangiovanni '' , entered into such prepared shades .For convenience we chose a stronger pigment , unknown to the early Italians or to Brumidi , titanium oxide , reserving the active lime white for highest lights , put on at the end of the day's stint .Other pigments were mostly raw umber , some burnt umber , and a little yellow ochre .This last was probably not in Brumidi's palette , but was needed to take the chill , bluish look off the new work next to the old , where softening effects of time were seen , even after thorough cleaning .The use of `` secco '' we tried to restrict to covering joints .Experience showed , however , that it is very difficult to paint a dark umber background in fresco that will not dry out spotty and uneven .Later Brumidi and Costaggini will be seen coping with this same problem .We were forced , as they were , to work a good deal of tempera into background and dark areas .We made it by Doerner's recipe , five parts thoroughly washed cheese curd to one of lime putty ; ;ground together they made a strong adhesive , which became waterproof in drying .Figure 1 was taken in 1953 .The new part is finished .On the right is the Brumidi Liberty group , as it looked after cleaning operations , which had not yet come around to the other end ; ;where , of Costaggini , only some foliage has been washed , at the point where his work stopped .One is led to speculate as to why the empty space was there , left for our century to finish .Costaggini said it was Brumidi's fault in not providing enough material to fill the circle .Brumidi's son later maintained that Costaggini had compressed and mutilated his father's designs , ambitiously coveting a bit he could claim for his very own .This question might be settled by comparing the measurement of the actual circumference with the dimensions noted , presumably in Brumidi's hand , above the various sections of his long preparatory drawing , which has been kept .Whosever fault , it is evident that Brumidi intended to fill out the whole frieze with his `` histories '' and come full circle with the scene of the discovery of California gold .In painting a fresco , the handling of wet mortar compels one always to move from top to bottom and from left to right , not to spoil yesterday's work with today's plastering .At the very first , then , Brumidi was required , by the classically pyramidal shape of his central group , to fill in the triangular space above the seated girl on Liberty's right , before starting on the allegorical figures themselves .Here he put a small man , whose missing hands might have left his function doubtful , until comparison with the first sketches showed that when the artist came back to the beginning , this was to be the closing figure of the party of `` forty-niners '' , and was to hold a basket .One sees Costaggini's rendering of the same figure more than thirty feet away .The photograph , Figure 1 of the completed frieze , shows how , having been separated from his fellows in useless isolation for eighty years , he has now been given a hand , and by juxtaposition ( and the permission of the Committee ) , given a new job , to represent the witnesses of the first flight at Kitty Hawk in 1903 .The startlingly bright effect of the first washings led the Committee to order the rest of the Brumidi-Costaggini cycle cleaned and restored to go with them .The fixed wooden scaffold was removed , and , so as to reach all the frieze , one of pipe , on wheels , built up from the floor .Every few days , in the early morning , as the work progressed , twenty men would appear to push it ahead and to shift the plank foundation that distributed its weight widely on the Rotunda pavement , supported as it is by ancient brick vaulting .On this giddy and oscillating platform over fifty feet from the floor , after a first dusting , we began to wash .A most useful tool for wetting the surface without running down was made from a greenhouse `` mist spray '' nozzle welded to a hose connection , to be used at low water pressure .A valve in the handle let us cut the pressure still lower .One man sprayed , with a sponge in hand to check excess wetting .A second assistant mopped with two sponges .In parts a repeated sponging was needed , but everywhere we found that water alone was enough to restore the original brightness .No soap or other cleaning agent was used that might bring in unwanted chemical reactions .The painting `` a fresco '' stood up superbly ; ;a little of the `` secco '' came off .Necessary retouching was put on at once .Altogether we found the craftsmanship first rate , especially Brumidi's .We were greatly helped by there being no traces of former restoring .Apparently not more than dusting had ever been done , and not much of that .The plaster was sound , the intonaco firmly attached all over , and the pigment solidly incorporated with it in all but a few unimportant places .The greatest source of trouble was rain which had repeatedly flowed from openings above , soaking the surface and leaving streaks of dissolved lime , very conspicuous even after cleaning , particularly in the `` Landing of Columbus '' , `` Oglethorpe and the Indians '' , and `` Yorktown '' .Here the Architect , referring to the use of the Capitol as a public building , not a museum , requested some repainting to maintain decorative effect , rather than leaving blank , unsightly patches .These frescos have had no care for eighty years .With naked gas jets below and leaky windows above , enough to ruin wall paintings in any medium , they have survived , in a building long unheated in winter , hot and damp under the iron dome in summer .This conclusion is dependent on the assumption that traditional sex mores will continue to sanction both premarital chastity as the `` ideal '' , and the double standard holding females primarily responsible for preserving the ideal .Our discussion of this involves using Erik Erikson's schema of `` identity vs. identity diffusion '' as a conceptual tool in superimposing a few common denominators onto the diverse personality and family configurations of the unwed mothers from whose case histories we quoted earlier .Our discussion does not utilize all the identity crises postulated by Erikson , but is intended to demonstrate the utility of his theoretical schema for studying unwed mothers .We hope thereby to emphasize that , from a psychological standpoint , the effectual prevention of illegitimacy is a continuous long-term process involving the socialization of the female from infancy through adolescence .Hypothesizing a series of developmental stages that begin in the individual's infancy and end in his old age , Erikson has indicated that the adolescent is faced with a series of identity crises .The successful and positive resolution of these crises during adolescence involves an epigenetic principle -- during adolescence , the individual's positive resolutions in each area of identity crisis depend , to a considerable degree , on his already having resolved preliminary and preparatory identity crises during his infancy , childhood , and early adolescence .Within Erikson's schema , the adolescent's delinquent behavior -- in this case , her unwed motherhood -- reflects her `` identity diffusion '' , or her inability to resolve these various identity crises positively .The adolescent experiences identity crises in terms of time perspective vs. time diffusion .Time perspective -- the ability to plan for the future and to postpone gratifying immediate wants in order to achieve long-range objectives -- is more easily developed if , from infancy on , the individual has been able to rely on and trust people and the world in which she lives .Erikson has noted that , unless this trust developed early , the time ambivalence experienced , in varying degree and temporarily , by all adolescents ( as a result of their remembering the more immediate gratification of wants during childhood , while not yet having fully accepted the long-range planning required by adulthood ) may develop into a more permanent sense of time diffusion .Experience of this time diffusion ranges from a sense of utter apathy to a feeling of desperate urgency to act immediately .These polar extremes in time diffusion were indicated in some of the comments by unwed mothers reported in earlier chapters .Some of these mothers , apparently feeling a desperate urgency , made , on the spur of the moment , commitments , in love and sex , that would have life-long consequences .Others displayed utter apathy and indifference to any decision about the past or the future .For many of these unwed mothers , the data on their family life and early childhood experiences revealed several indications and sources of their basic mistrust of their parents in particular and of the world in general .However , as Erickson has noted , the individual's failure to develop preliminary identities during infancy and childhood need not be irreversibly deterministic with respect to a given area of identity diffusion in his ( or her ) adolescence .And , as shown in Chapter 6 , , some SNP females originally developed such trust only during their adolescence , through the aid of , and their identification with , alter-parents .In the specific case of time diffusion , we must emphasize the significance of the earlier development of mistrust when it is combined with the inevitable time crisis experienced by most ( if not all ) adolescents in our society , and with the failure of the adolescent period to provide opportunities for developing trust .The adolescent experiences two closely related crises : self-certainty vs. an identity consciousness ; ;and role-experimentation vs. negative identity .A sense of self-certainty and the freedom to experiment with different roles , or confidence in one's own unique behavior as an alternative to peer-group conformity , is more easily developed during adolescence if , during early childhood , the individual was permitted to exercise initiative and encouraged to develop some autonomy .However , if the child has been constantly surrounded , during nursery and early school age , by peer groups ; ;inculcated with the primacy of group acceptance and group standards ; ;and allowed little initiative in early play and work patterns -- then in adolescence her normal degree of vanity , sensitivity , and preoccupation with whether others find her appearance and behavior acceptable , will be compounded .Her ostensible indifference to and rebellion against suggestions and criticisms by anyone except peer friends during adolescence are the manifestations , in her adolescence , of her having been indoctrinated in childhood to feel shame , if not guilt , for failing to behave in a manner acceptable to , and judged by , the performance of her nursery- and elementary-school peer friends .To be different is to invite shame and doubt ; ;and it is better to be shamed and criticized by one's parents , who already consider one different and difficult to understand , than by one's peers , who are also experiencing a similar groping for and denial of adult status .The attitudes of some unwed mothers quoted in Chapter 2 , , revealed both considerable preoccupation with being accepted by others and a marked absence of self-certainty .Many appeared to regard their sexual behavior as a justifiable means of gaining acceptance from and identification with others ; ;but very few seemed aware that such acceptance and identification need to be supplemented with more enduring and stable identification of and with one's self .Another identity crisis confronting the adolescent involves anticipation of achievement vs. work-paralysis .The adolescent's capacity to anticipate achievement and to exercise the self-discipline necessary to complete tasks successfully depends on the degree to which he or she developed autonomy , initiative , and self-discipline during childhood .The developmental process involves the individual's progressively experiencing a sense of dignity and achievement resulting from having completed tasks , having kept commitments , and having created something ( however small or simple -- even a doll dress of one's own design rather than in the design `` it ought to be '' ) .These childhood experiences are sources of the self-certainty that the adolescent needs , for experimenting with many roles , and for the freedom to fail sometimes in the process of exploring and discovering her skills and abilities .If she has not had such experiences , the female's normal adolescent degree of indecision will be compounded .She may well be incapacitated by it when she is confronted with present and future alternatives -- e.g. , whether to prepare primarily for a career or for the role of a homemaker ; ;whether to stay financially dependent on her parents or help support herself while attending school ; ;whether to pursue a college education or a job after high school ; ;and whether to attend this or that college and to follow this or that course of study .Erikson has noted that , as this indecision mounts , it may result in a `` paralysis of workmanship '' .This paralysis may be expressed in the female's starting -- and never completing -- many jobs , tasks , and courses of study ; ;and in the fact that she bases her decisions about work , college , carreer , and studies on what others are doing , rather than on her own sense of identity with given skills , abilities , likes , and dislikes .The absence , during her childhood and early adolescence , of experiences in developing the self-discipline to complete tasks within her ability -- experiences that would have been subsequent sources of anticipation of achievement -- and her lack of childhood opportunities to practice autonomy and initiative in play and expression , both tend in her adolescence to deprive her of the freedoms to role-experiment and to fail occasionally in experimenting .The comments made by some unwed mothers ( quoted in Chapter 2 ) ) reflect this paralysis of workmanship .They attended school and selected courses primarily on the basis of decisions others made ; ;they accepted a job primarily because it was available , convenient , and paid reasonably .These things both express and , at the same time , continue contributing to , their identity diffusion in an area that could have become a source of developing dignity and self-certainty .As their identity diffusion increased , they became more susceptible to sporadic diversions in love and sexual affairs .These affairs temporarily relieved the monotony of school or work activities containing no anticipation of achievement and joy of craftsmanship , no sense of dignity derived from a job well done .Childhood experiences in learning work and self-discipline habits within a context of developing autonomy and initiative have considerable significance for the prevention of illegitimacy .The excerpts from case histories presented above confirm this significance , though through different facets of experience .For example , some unwed mothers had had no work experiences , household chores , and responsibilities during childhood and early adolescence ; ;they subsequently occupied their leisure hours in searching for something exciting and diverting .Sex was both .On the other hand , some unwed mothers had had so much work and responsibility imposed on them at an early age , and had thus had so little freedom or opportunity to develop autonomy and initiative , that their work and responsibilities became dull and unrewarding burdens -- to be escaped and rebelled against through fun and experimentation with forbidden sexual behavior .The adolescent also faces the identity crisis that Erikson has termed ideological polarization vs. diffusion of ideals .In discussing the ways this crisis is germane to consderations for the prevention of illegitimacy , we shall again superimpose Erikson's concept on our data .Adolescents have a much-discussed tendency to polarize ideas and values , to perceive things as `` either-or '' , black or white -- nuances of meaning are relatively unimportant .This tendency is , perhaps , most clearly revealed in the literature on religious conversions and experiences of adolescents .Erikson has postulated that such ideological polarization temporarily resolves their search for something stable and definite in the rapidly changing and fluctuating no-man's-land between childhood and adulthood .It provides identification -- with an idea , a value , a cause that cuts through , or even transcends , the multiple and ambivalent identities of their passage from child to adult , and permits their forceful and overt expression of emotion .The positive development , during adolescence , of this capacity to think and to feel strongly and with increasing independence , and to identify overtly either with or against given ideas , values , and practices , depends to a considerable degree on both previous and present opportunities for developing autonomy , initiative , and self-certainty .Most adolescents have some ideological diffusion at various developmental stages , as they experience a proliferation of ideas and values .The diffusion is most pronounced and most likely to become fixed , however , in those who have had no or very minimal opportunities to develop the autonomy and initiative that could have been directed into constructive expression and so served as sources of developing self-certainty .A pronounced ideological diffusion -- i.e. , inability to identify independently with given ideas and value systems -- is reflected in many ways .For example , it is evinced by the adolescent ( or adult ) whose beliefs and actions represent primarily his rebellion and reaction against the ideas and behavior patterns of others , rather than his inner conviction and choice .It is mirrored by the individual Willie Lohmans , whose ideas and behavior patterns are so dependent and relativistic that they always coincide with those of the individual or group present and most important at the moment .In another sense , it is represented in the arguments of the `` true believers '' who seek to disprove the validity of all other beliefs and ideas in order to retain confidence in theirs .The case histories provide some interesting illustrations of ideological diffusion , embodied in the unwed mother's inability to identify independently a given value system or behavior pattern , , and her subsequent disinclination to assume any individual responsibility for her sexual behavior .For example , the unwed mothers expressed their frustration with males who did not indicate more explicitly `` what it is they really want from a girl so one can act accordingly '' .They were disappointed by the physical and emotional hurt of premarital sexual intercourse .They condemned the movie script writers for implying that sex was enjoyable and exhilarating .They criticized parents for never having emphasized traditional concepts of right and wrong ; ;and they censured parents who `` never disciplined and were too permissive '' or who `` never explained how easy it was to get pregnant '' .In the adult world , there are a number of rather general and diffuse sources of ideological diffusion that further compound the adolescent's search for meaning during this particular identity crisis .For example , some contemporary writing tends to fuse the `` good guys '' and the `` bad guys '' , to portray the weak people as heroes and weakness as a virtue , and to explain ( or even justify ) asocial behavior by attributing it to deterministic psychological , familial , and social experiences .She was carrying a quirt , and she started to raise it , then let it fall again and dangle from her wrist .`` I saw your fire '' , she said , speaking slowly , making an effort to control her anger .`` You could burn down this whole mountainside with a fire that size .It wouldn't matter to a fool like you .It would to me '' .`` All right '' , Wilson said quickly .`` The fire's too big .And I appreciate the advice '' .He was losing patience again .An hour before , with the children asleep and nothing but the strange darkness , he would have appreciated company .She had helped him change his mind .`` I'm not advising you '' , she said .`` I'm telling you .That fire's too big .Let it burn down .And make sure it's out when you leave in the morning '' .He was taken aback .It took him a long time to compose himself .`` There's some mistake '' , he said finally .`` You're right about the fire .It's bigger than it has to be , though I don't see where it's doing any harm .But you're wrong about the rest of it .I'm not leaving in the morning .Why should I ? ?I own the place '' .She showed her surprise by tightening the reins and moving the gelding around so that she could get a better look at his face .It didn't seem to tell her anything .She glanced around the clearing , taking in the wagon and the load of supplies and trappings scattered over the ground , the two kids , the whiteface bull that was chewing its cud just within the far reaches of the firelight .She studied it for a long time .Then she turned back to Wilson and smiled , and he wasn't quite sure what she meant by it .`` You own this place '' ? ?She said , and her tone had softened until it was almost friendly .`` You bought it '' ? ?`` From a man in St. Louis '' , Wilson said .`` Jake Carwood .Maybe you know him '' .The girl laughed .`` I know him .I ought to .My father ran him off here six years ago '' .Wilson didn't say anything .He stood watching the girl , wondering what was coming next .She had picked up the quirt and was twirling it around her wrist and smiling at him .`` Carwood didn't tell you that '' , she said .`` No '' , Wilson said .`` But it's understandable .It's not the kind of thing that a man would be proud of .And it doesn't make any difference .He sold me a clear title .I have it with me , right here .If you want to see '' --`` Never mind '' , she said sternly .`` It wouldn't matter to my father , and not to me .I meant what I said about that fire .Be sure it's out when you leave .That's all .I'll let you go back to doing the dishes now '' .It was meant to insult him , and didn't quite succeed .He took the reins just below the bit and held them firmly , and it was his turn to smile now .`` I don't mind washing dishes now and then '' , he said pleasantly .`` It doesn't hurt .It might hurt you , though .Somebody might mistake you for a woman '' .He meant to say more , but he never got the chance .She was quick .She brought the quirt down , slashing it across his cheek , and he tried to step back .She swung the quirt again , and this time he caught her wrist and pulled her out of the saddle .She came down against him , and he tried to break her fall .He grabbed her by the shoulders and went down on one knee , taking her weight so that some of the wind was driven out of him .It made him a little sick , and he let go of her .He got up slowly , and she was already on her feet , and he stood facing her .He wiped the blood from his cheek .`` I ought to '' -- he said .He was shaking with anger , his breath coming in long , painful gasps .`` That quirt -- I ought to use it on you , where it would do the most good .If you were a man '' --`` She isn't , mister '' .The voice came from behind him , and Wilson turned .The fire had gone down , and the man was only a shadow against the trees .But a moment later he brought his horse forward into the light , and Wilson had a good look at him .He was tall and dark-skinned , a half-breed , Wilson thought .And he was handsome , despite the long thin scar that slanted across his cheek .`` She's not a man , mister '' , he said .`` I am .If you've got any ideas '' .He raised the Winchester and pointed it at Wilson's chest .`` Put the rifle down , Joseph '' , the girl said .She seemed irritated .`` I thought I told you to stay home '' .The half-breed eased the Winchester down and rested it across his lap .The scar looked pure white in the half-darkness ; ;his eyes were black and deep-set , and expressionless .`` You shouldn't be riding up here after dark , Judith '' , he said quietly .`` I can take care of this .It's no job for you '' .The girl tapped the quirt impatiently against her knee and glared at him .He took it without flinching .`` I said go home , Joseph .You've got no business up here '' .The half-breed didn't answer this time .But the scar seemed to pull hard at the corner of his mouth , and his eyes were hurt and angry .It made Wilson wonder .He watched the half-breed as he turned silently .They could hear the pony's feet on the dry leaves for a while , then the sound faded out .Wilson brushed the dust from his coat .`` Who was that '' ? ?He asked .`` Your personal guard ? ?You're pretty hard on him '' .`` He works for my father '' , the girl said , and then seemed to change her mind .`` He's a friend .His name's Joseph Sanchez .Is there anything else you want to know '' ? ?`` Not now '' , Wilson said .`` I guess I'll find out soon enough .You've got blood on your cheek .Not yours .Mine .It must have got there when you fell against me '' .She wiped it off with the sleeve of her coat .`` I'll bet that's as close as you've been to a man since you were a baby '' , Wilson said .He saw her hand start to work down the leather thong toward the handle of the quirt , and he grabbed her wrist .`` Oh , no '' , he said , and he was without humor now .`` I've had enough of that .I've had enough of you .I don't know what goes on around here , and I don't care .I don't know what makes you think you can get away with this kind of business , and I don't care about that , either .You took me by surprise .But I'll know how to handle you next time '' .She brought up her free hand to hit him , but this time he was quicker .He side-stepped her blow and she fell , stumbling against the gelding .She finally regained her balance and got up in the saddle .Her hat had come off and fallen behind her shoulders , held by the string , and he could see her face more clearly than he had at any time before .He had forgotten that she was so pretty .But her prettiness was what he had noticed first , and all the other things had come afterward : cruelty , meanness , self-will .He had known women like that , one woman in particular .And one had been too many .He watched the girl until she had gone into the trees , and waited until he couldn't hear the sound of her horse any longer , then went up to where the children were sleeping .They weren't sleeping , of course , but they thought they were doing him a favor by pretending .He hadn't shown up too well in their eyes , letting himself be browbeaten by a woman .They expected greater things from him , regardless of how trying the circumstances , and they were disappointed .And determined not to show it .They lay a little too stiffly , with their eyes straining to stay closed .`` Go to sleep '' , he said .`` Both of you .There's better things to do than listen to something like that .I'll be down at the creek finishing the dishes , if you want me '' .He found the pan where he had dropped it and carried it back down to the stream .The coyote was calling again , and he hoped that this time there would be no other sounds to interrupt it .Not tonight , at any rate .He had a feeling that the girl meant trouble .If she did , he could stand it better in the light .He scrubbed absent-mindedly at the pans and reflected on how things had turned out .That afternoon when they had pulled up in front of the broken-down ranch house , his hopes had been high .Already some of the pain had gone from Amelia's death .Not all of it .There would still be plenty of moments of regret and sadness and guilty relief .But they were starting a new life .And they had almost everything they needed : land , a house , two whiteface bulls , three horses .The land wasn't all Wilson had expected of it .Six hundred and forty acres , the old man back in St. Louis had said ; ;good grass , good water .Well , the grass was there , though in some places the ground was too steep for a cow to get to it .The water was there , so much of it that it spread all through the dead orchard .And there was a house ; ;livable perhaps , but badly in need of repairs .In the last analysis , though , Wilson had little cause to complain .The place had been cheap -- just the little he had left after Amelia's burial -- and it would serve its purpose .There was only one place where Jake Carwood's description had gone badly awry : the peace and quiet .It hadn't started out that way .And he had a feeling -- thanks to the girl -- that things would get worse before they got better .2They had the house cleaned up by noon , and Wilson sent the boy out to the meadow to bring in the horses .He stood on the porch and watched him struggling with the heavy harness , and finally went over to help him .Kathy was already in the wagon .They were going to town , and they were both excited .Wilson backed the team into the traces , and wished they weren't going to town at all .He had an uneasy feeling about it .That girl last night , what was her name ? ?Judith Pierce .It was the only thing about her that was the least bit hard to remember .He finished with the team and filled his pipe and stood looking about him .He had spent two hours riding around the ranch that morning , and in broad daylight it was even less inviting than Judith Pierce had made it seem .There was brush , and stands of pine that no grass could grow under , and places so steep that cattle wouldn't stop to graze .But there was water .There was an artificial lake just out of sight in the first stand of trees , fed by a half dozen springs that popped out of the ground above the hillside orchard .Yes , there was plenty of water , too much , and that was probably the trouble .There were tracks of cattle all over his six hundred and forty acres .The first part of the road was steep , but it leveled off after the second bend and curled gradually into the valley .It was hotter once they reached the flat , and drier , but the grass was better .A warm breeze played across it , moving it like waves .A red-tailed hawk flew in behind them and stayed there , watching for any snakes or rabbits that they might stir up from the side of the road .It took them an hour before they came to the first houses of Kelseyville .The town was about what Wilson expected : one main street with its rows of false-fronted buildings , a water tower , a few warehouses , a single hotel ; ;all dusty and sunbaked .The place was quiet .Rather than being deceived , the eye is puzzled ; ;instead of seeing objects in space , it sees nothing more than -- a picture .Through 1911 and 1912 , as the Cubist facet-plane's tendency to adhere to the literal surface became harder and harder to deny , the task of keeping the surface at arm's length fell all the more to eye-undeceiving contrivances .To reinforce , and sometimes to replace , the simulated typography , Braque and Picasso began to mix sand and other foreign substances with their paint ; ;the granular texture thus created likewise called attention to the reality of the surface and was effective over much larger areas .In certain other pictures , however , Braque began to paint areas in exact simulation of wood graining or marbleizing .These areas , by virtue of their abrupt density of pattern , stated the literal surface with such new and superior force that the resulting contrast drove the simulated printing into a depth from which it could be rescued -- and set to shuttling again -- only by conventional perspective ; ;that is , by being placed in such relation to the forms depicted within the illusion that these forms left no room for the typography except near the surface .The accumulation of such devices , however , soon had the effect of telescoping , even while separating , surface and depth .The process of flattening seemed inexorable , and it became necessary to emphasize the surface still further in order to prevent it from fusing with the illusion .It was for this reason , and no other that I can see , that in September 1912 , Braque took the radical and revolutionary step of pasting actual pieces of imitation-woodgrain wallpaper to a drawing on paper , instead of trying to simulate its texture in paint .Picasso says that he himself had already made his first collage toward the end of 1911 , when he glued a piece of imitation-caning oilcloth to a painting on canvas .It is true that his first collage looks more Analytical than Braque's , which would confirm the date he assigns it .But it is also true that Braque was the consistent pioneer in the use of simulated textures as well as of typography ; ;and moreover , he had already begun to broaden and simplify the facet-planes of Analytical Cubism as far back as the end of 1910 .When we examine what each master says was his first collage we see that much the same thing happens in each .( It makes no real difference that Braque's collage is on paper and eked out in charcoal , while Picasso's is on canvas and eked out in oil .) By its greater corporeal presence and its greater extraneousness , the affixed paper or cloth serves for a seeming moment to push everything else into a more vivid idea of depth than the simulated printing or simulated textures had ever done .But here again , the surface-declaring device both overshoots and falls short of its aim .For the illusion of depth created by the contrast between the affixed material and everything else gives way immediately to an illusion of forms in bas-relief , which gives way in turn , and with equal immediacy , to an illusion that seems to contain both -- or neither .Because of the size of the areas it covers , the pasted paper establishes undepicted flatness bodily , as more than an indication or sign .Literal flatness now tends to assert itself as the main event of the picture , and the device boomerangs : the illusion of depth is rendered even more precarious than before .Instead of isolating the literal flatness by specifying and circumscribing it , the pasted paper or cloth releases and spreads it , and the artist seems to have nothing left but this undepicted flatness with which to finish as well as start his picture .The actual surface becomes both ground and background , and it turns out -- suddenly and paradoxically -- that the only place left for a three-dimensional illusion is in front of , upon , the surface .In their very first collages , Braque and Picasso draw or paint over and on the affixed paper or cloth , so that certain of the principal features of their subjects as depicted seem to thrust out into real , bas-relief space -- or to be about to do so -- while the rest of the subject remains imbedded in , or flat upon , the surface .And the surface is driven back , in its very surfaceness , only by this contrast .In the upper center of Braque's first collage , Fruit Dish ( in Douglas Cooper's collection ) , a bunch of grapes is rendered with such conventionally vivid sculptural effect as to lift it practically off the picture plane .The trompe-l'oeil illusion here is no longer enclosed between parallel flatnesses , but seems to thrust through the surface of the drawing paper and establish depth on top of it .Yet the violent immediacy of the wallpaper strips pasted to the paper , and the only lesser immediacy of block capitals that simulate window lettering , manage somehow to push the grape cluster back into place on the picture plane so that it does not `` jump '' .At the same time , the wallpaper strips themselves seem to be pushed into depth by the lines and patches of shading charcoaled upon them , and by their placing in relation to the block capitals ; ;and these capitals seem in turn to be pushed back by their placing , and by contrast with the corporeality of the woodgraining .Thus every part and plane of the picture keeps changing place in relative depth with every other part and plane ; ;and it is as if the only stable relation left among the different parts of the picture is the ambivalent and ambiguous one that each has with the surface .And the same thing , more or less , can be said of the contents of Picasso's first collage .In later collages of both masters , a variety of extraneous materials are used , sometimes in the same work , and almost always in conjunction with every other eye-deceiving and eye-undeceiving device they can think of .The area adjacent to one edge of a piece of affixed material -- or simply of a painted-in form -- will be shaded to pry that edge away from the surface , while something will be drawn , painted or even pasted over another part of the same shape to drive it back into depth .Planes defined as parallel to the surface also cut through it into real space , and a depth is suggested optically which is greater than that established pictorially .All this expands the oscillation between surface and depth so as to encompass fictive space in front of the surface as well as behind it .Flatness may now monopolize everything , but it is a flatness become so ambiguous and expanded as to turn into illusion itself -- at least an optical if not , properly speaking , a pictorial illusion .Depicted , Cubist flatness is now almost completely assimilated to the literal , undepicted kind , but at the same time it reacts upon and largely transforms the undepicted kind -- and it does so , moreover , without depriving the latter of its literalness ; ;rather , it underpins and reinforces that literalness , re-creates it .Out of this re-created literalness , the Cubist subject reemerged .For it had turned out , by a further paradox of Cubism , that the means to an illusion of depth and plasticity had now become widely divergent from the means of representation or imaging .In the Analytical phase of their Cubism , Braque and Picasso had not only had to minimize three-dimensionality simply in order to preserve it ; ;they had also had to generalize it -- to the point , finally , where the illusion of depth and relief became abstracted from specific three-dimensional entities and was rendered largely as the illusion of depth and relief as such : as a disembodied attribute and expropriated property detached from everything not itself .In order to be saved , plasticity had had to be isolated ; ;and as the aspect of the subject was transposed into those clusters of more or less interchangeable and contour-obliterating facet-planes by which plasticity was isolated under the Cubist method , the subject itself became largely unrecognizable .Cubism , in its 1911-1912 phase ( which the French , with justice , call `` hermetic '' ) was on the verge of abstract art .It was then that Picasso and Braque were confronted with a unique dilemma : they had to choose between illusion and representation .If they opted for illusion , it could only be illusion per se -- an illusion of depth , and of relief , so general and abstracted as to exclude the representation of individual objects .If , on the other hand , they opted for representation , it had to be representation per se -- representation as image pure and simple , without connotations ( at least , without more than schematic ones ) of the three-dimensional space in which the objects represented originally existed .It was the collage that made the terms of this dilemma clear : the representational could be restored and preserved only on the flat and literal surface now that illusion and representation had become , for the first time , mutually exclusive alternatives .In the end , Picasso and Braque plumped for the representational , and it would seem they did so deliberately .( This provides whatever real justification there is for the talk about `` reality '' .) But the inner , formal logic of Cubism , as it worked itself out through the collage , had just as much to do with shaping their decision .When the smaller facet-planes of Analytical Cubism were placed upon or juxtaposed with the large , dense shapes formed by the affixed materials of the collage , they had to coalesce -- become `` synthesized '' -- into larger planar shapes themselves simply in order to maintain the integrity of the picture plane .Left in their previous atom-like smallness , they would have cut away too abruptly into depth ; ;and the broad , opaque shapes of pasted paper would have been isolated in such a way as to make them jump out of plane .Large planes juxtaposed with other large planes tend to assert themselves as independent shapes , and to the extent that they are flat , they also assert themselves as silhouettes ; ;and independent silhouettes are apt to coincide with the recognizable contours of the subject from which a picture starts ( if it does start from a subject ) .It was because of this chain-reaction as much as for any other reason -- that is , because of the growing independence of the planar unit in collage as a shape -- that the identity of depicted objects , or at least parts of them , re-emerged in Braque's and Picasso's papiers colles and continued to remain more conspicuous there -- but only as flattened silhouettes -- than in any of their paintings done wholly in oil before the end of 1913 .Analytical Cubism came to an end in the collage , but not conclusively ; ;nor did Synthetic Cubism fully begin there .Only when the collage had been exhaustively translated into oil , and transformed by this translation , did Cubism become an affair of positive color and flat , interlocking silhouettes whose legibility and placement created allusions to , if not the illusion of , unmistakable three-dimensional identities .Synthetic Cubism began with Picasso alone , late in 1913 or early in 1914 ; ;this was the point at which he finally took the lead in Cubist innovation away from Braque , never again to relinquish it .But even before that , Picasso had glimpsed and entered , for a moment , a certain revolutionary path in which no one had preceded him .It was as though , in that instant , he had felt the flatness of collage as too constricting and had suddenly tried to escape all the way back -- or forward -- to literal three-dimensionality .This he did by using utterly literal means to carry the forward push of the collage ( and of Cubism in general ) literally into the literal space in front of the picture plane .Some time in 1912 , Picasso cut out and folded a piece of paper in the shape of a guitar ; ;to this he glued and fitted other pieces of paper and four taut strings , thus creating a sequence of flat surfaces in real and sculptural space to which there clung only the vestige of a picture plane .The affixed elements of collage were extruded , as it were , and cut off from the literal pictorial surface to form a bas-relief .In American romance , almost nothing rates higher than what the movie men have called `` meeting cute '' -- that is , boy-meets-girl seems more adorable if it doesn't take place in an atmosphere of correct and acute boredom .Just about the most enthralling real-life example of meeting cute is the Charles MacArthur-Helen Hayes saga : reputedly all he did was give her a handful of peanuts , but he said simultaneously , `` I wish they were emeralds '' .Aside from the comico-romantico content here , a good linguist-anthropologist could readily pick up a few other facts , especially if he had a little more of the conversation to go on .The way MacArthur said his line -- if you had the recorded transcript of a professional linguist -- would probably have gone like this : Af Primary stresses on emeralds and wish ; ;note pitch 3 ( pretty high ) on emeralds but with a slight degree of drawl , one degree of oversoftness .Conclusions : The people involved ( and subsequent facts bear me out here ) knew clearly the relative values of peanuts and emeralds , both monetary and sentimental .And the drawling , oversoft voice of flirtation , though fairly overt , was still well within the prescribed gambit of their culture .In other words , like automation machines designed to work in tandem , they shared the same programming , a mutual understanding not only of English words , but of the four stresses , pitches , and junctures that can change their meaning from black to white .At this point , unfortunately , romance becomes a regrettably small part of the picture ; ;but consider , if you can bear it , what might have happened if MacArthur , for some perverse , undaunted reason , had made the same remark to an Eskimo girl in Eskimo .To her peanuts and emeralds would have been just so much blubber .The point -- quite simply -- is this : words they might have had ; ;but communication , no .This basic principle , the first in a richly knotted bundle , was conveyed to me by Dr. Henry Lee Smith , Jr. , at the University of Buffalo , where he heads the world's first department of anthropology and linguistics .A brisk , amusing man , apparently constructed on an ingenious system of spring-joints attuned to the same peppery rhythm as his mind , Smith began his academic career teaching speech to Barnard girls -- a project considerably enlivened by his devotion to a recording about `` a young rat named Arthur , who never could make up his mind '' .Later , he became one of the central spirits of the Army Language Program and the language school of Washington's Foreign Service Institute .It was there , in the course of trying to prepare new men for the `` culture shock '' they might encounter in remote overseas posts , that he first began to develop a system of charting the `` norms of human communication '' .To the trained ear of the linguist , talk has always revealed a staggering quantity of information about the talker -- such things as geographical origin and history , socio-economic identity , education .It is only fairly recently , however , that linguists have developed a systematic way of charting voices on paper in a way that tells even more about the speakers and about the success or failure of human communication between two people .This , for obvious reasons , makes their techniques superbly useful in studying the psychiatric interview , so useful , in fact , that they have been successfully used to suggest ways to speed diagnosis and to evaluate the progress of therapy .In the early 1950's , Smith , together with his distinguished colleague , George Trager ( so austerely academic he sometimes fights his own evident charm ) , and a third man with the engaging name of Birdwhistell ( Ray ) , agreed on some basic premises about the three-part process that makes communication : ( 1 ) words or language ( 2 ) paralanguage , a set of phenomena including laughing , weeping , voice breaks , and `` tone '' of voice , and ( 3 ) kinesics , the technical name for gestures , facial expressions , and body shifts -- nodding or shaking the head , `` talking '' with one's hands , et cetera .Smith's first workout with stresses , pitches , and junctures was based on mother , which spells , in our culture , a good deal more than bread alone .For example , if you are a reasonably well-adjusted person , there are certain ways that are reasonable and appropriate for addressing your mother .The usual U.S. norm would be : Af Middle pitches , slight pause ( juncture ) before mother , slight rise at the end .The symbols of mother's status , here , are all usual for culture U.S.A. .Quite other feelings are evidenced by this style : Af Note the drop to pitch 1 ( the lowest ) on mother with no rise at the end of the sentence ; ;this is a `` fade '' ending , and what you have here is a downtalking style of speech , expressing something less than conventional respect for mother .Even less regard for mom and mom's apple pie goes with : Af In other words , the way the speaker relates to mother is clearly indicated .And while the meaning of the words is not in this instance altered , the quality of communication in both the second and third examples is definitely impaired .An accompanying record of paralanguage factors for the second example might also note a throaty rasp .With this seven-word sentence -- though the speaker undoubtedly thought he was dealing only with the subject of food -- he was telling things about himself and , in the last two examples , revealing that he had departed from the customs of his culture .The joint investigations of linguistics and psychiatry have established , in point of fact , that no matter what the subject of conversation is or what words are involved , it is impossible for people to talk at all without telling over and over again what sort of people they are and how they relate to the rest of the world .Since interviewing is the basic therapeutic and diagnostic instrument of modern psychiatry , the recording of interviews for playbacks and study has been a boost of Redstone proportions in new research and training .Some of the earliest recordings , made in the 1940's demonstrated that psychiatrists reacted immediately to anger and anxiety in the sound track , whereas written records of the same interview offered far fewer cues to therapy which -- if they were at all discernible in print -- were picked up only by the most skilled and sensitive experts .In a general way , psychiatrists were able to establish on a wide basis what many of them had always felt -- that the most telling cues in psychotherapy are acoustic , that such things as stress and nagging are transmitted by sound alone and not necessarily by words .At a minimum , recording -- usually on tape , which is now in wide professional use -- brings the psychiatric interview alive so that the full range of emotion and meaning can be explored repeatedly by the therapist or by a battery of therapists .Newest to this high-powered battery are the experts in linguistics who have carried that minimum to a new level .By adding a systematic analysis with symbols to the typed transcripts of interviews , they have supplied a new set of techniques for the therapist .Linguistic charting of the transcribed interview flags points where the patient's voice departs from expected norms .It flags such possible breakdowns of communication as rehearsed dialogue , the note of disapproval , ambivalence or ambiguity , annoyance , resentment , and the disinclination to speak at all -- this last often marked by a fade-in beginning of sentences .Interpretation , naturally , remains the role of the therapist , but orientation -- not only the patient's vocal giveaways of geographical and socio-economic background , but also vocal but non-verbal giveaways of danger spots in his relationship to people -- can be considerably beefed up by the linguist .His esoteric chartings of the voice alert the therapist to areas where deeper probing may bring to light underlying psychological difficulties , making them apparent first to the therapist and eventually to the patient .In one now-historic first interview , for example , the transcript ( reproduced from the book , The First Five Minutes ) goes like this : The therapist's level tone is bland and neutral -- he has , for example , avoided stressing `` you '' , which would imply disapproval ; ;or surprise , which would set the patient apart from other people .The patient , on the other hand , is far from neutral ; ;aside from her specifically regional accent , she reveals by the use of the triad , `` irritable , tense , depressed '' , a certain pedantic itemization that indicates she has some familiarity with literary or scientific language ( i.e. , she must have had at least a high-school education ) , and she is telling a story she has mentally rehearsed some time before .Then she catapults into `` everything and everybody '' , putting particular violence on `` everybody '' , indicating to the linguist that this is a spot to flag -- that is , it is not congruent to the patient's general style of speech up to this point .Consequently , it is referred to the therapist for attention .He may then very well conclude that `` everybody '' is probably not the true target of her resentment .Immediately thereafter , the patient fractures her rehearsed story , veering into an oversoft , breathy , sloppily articulated , `` I don't feel like talking right now '' .Within the first five minutes of this interview it is apparent to the therapist that `` everybody '' truthfully refers to the woman's husband .She says later , but still within the opening five minutes , `` I keep thinking of a divorce but that's another emotional death '' .The linguistic and paralinguistic signals of misery are all present in the voice chart for this sentence ; ;so are certain signals that she does not accept divorce .By saying `` another emotional death '' , she reveals that there has been a previous one , although she has not described it in words .This the therapist may pursue in later questioning .The phrase , `` emotional death '' , interesting and , to a non-scientific mind , rather touching , suggests that this woman may have some flair for words , perhaps even something of the temperament regrettably called `` creative '' .Since the psychiatric interview , like any other interview , depends on communication , it is significant to note that the therapist in this interview was a man of marked skill and long experience .His own communication apparatus operated superbly , and Lillian Ross readers will note instantly its total lack of resemblance to the blunted , monumentally unmeshed mechanism of Dr. Blauberman .Interestingly enough -- although none of the real-life therapists involved could conceivably compare with Blauberman -- when groups of them began playing back interviews , they discovered any number of ways in which they wanted to polish their own interview techniques ; ;almost everyone , on first hearing one of his own sessions on tape , expressed some desire to take the whole thing over again .Yet , in spite of this , intensive study of the taped interviews by teams of psychotherapists and linguists laid bare the surprising fact that , in the first five minutes of an initial interview , the patient often reveals as many as a dozen times just what's wrong with him ; ;to spot these giveaways the therapist must know either intuitively or scientifically how to listen .Naturally , the patient does not say , `` I hate my father '' , or `` Sibling rivalry is what bugs me '' .What he does do is give himself away by communicating information over and above the words involved .Some of the classic indicators , as described by Drs. Pittenger , Hockett , and Danehy in The First Five Minutes , are these : ambiguity of pronouns :Stammering or repetition of I , you , he , she , et cetera may signal ambiguity or uncertainty .On the other hand significant facts may be concealed -- she may mean I or everybody , as it did with the tense and irritable woman mentioned before , may refer to a specific person .The word that is not used can be as important as the word that is used ; ;therapist and linguist must always consider the alternatives .When someone says , for example , `` They took x-rays to see that there was nothing wrong with me '' , it pays to consider how this statement would normally be made .( This patient , in actuality , was a neurasthenic who had almost come to the point of accepting the fact that it was not her soma but her psyche that was the cause of her difficulty .) Amateur linguists note here that Pursewarden , in Durrell's Alexandria Quartet , stammered when he spoke of his wife , which is hardly surprising in view of their disastrous relationship .Gavin paused wearily .`` You can't stay here with me .It's late and you said they'd be here by dawn '' .`` You can't make me go '' .Gavin sank down again into his chair and began to rock .He was thinking of Rittenhouse and how he had left him there , to rock to death on the porch of the Splendide .It was the only thing in his life for which he felt guilt .Beneath his black shirt his frail shoulders shook and croaks of pain broke from his throat , the stored pain shattering free in slow gasps , terrible to see .Clayton tried to call back the face of the man he had known .Against that other man he could rally his anger ; ;against this bent man in the chair he was powerless .Gavin's lips moved so that Clayton had to stoop to catch the words .`` Do you remember Big Charlie '' ? ?He whispered .`` He stuck with me all these years .Just a half-breed 'pache , never said much , never meant anythin to me , but he stuck with me .He got into a fight with Tom English , your brother's son .It was a fair fight , the boy provoked it -- Big Charlie told me so .I believed him .They killed Big Charlie , dumped his body in my rose garden two nights ago .My men , they all left me .Just cleared out .I didn't understand why , Clay .They just all cleared out .I treated them fair ''He wiped his lips with a sleeve , then stared at Clayton in a childish kind of wonder .`` Do you mean '' -- he asked almost shyly -- `` you want me to go with you , wherever you're goin '' ? ?`` Yes '' .`` You don't hate me any more '' ? ?Clayton choked , shook his head , murmuring , `` No '' .`` Come here '' .The old man beckoned with one finger and Clayton went forward to him .Gavin slipped his arms around his chest and hugged him fiercely .`` All my life '' , he said , `` I tried .I tried .I saw you driftin away -- but I tried .And you wanted no part of me when I had so much to give .Now there's nothin left of me .Laurel is gone , my men are gone , Ed is dead -- and you come to me , to help me .Oh ! !God in Heaven , I can't refuse you now .That would mock me too much ! !Can't let you go way from me again '' He closed his eyes , ashamed of his tears .`` I'll go , Clay '' .Clayton freed himself from the embrace and stepped back .The eyes followed him fearfully .`` The horses .There isn't much time .I'll saddle the horses and bring them round .You get ready ''He burst from the hot confinement of the room into the cold night air .Gavin's stallion was in the barn and he tightened the cinches over the saddle blanket , working by touch in the darkness , comforting the animal with easy words .When he had finished he led him and the mare to the porch .The stallion had smelled the mare coming into heat and began to paw the turf , shaking his head .Clayton looped the reins in a knot over the veranda post and patted the warm flesh of his neck .The mare had backed away .`` You take it easy , boy '' , Clayton whispered .`` She doesn't want you now .You take it easy , your time will come '' .Gavin stood on the porch , a thin figure .He had taken a carbine down from the wall and it trailed from his hand , the stock bumping on the wood floor .Clayton called to him and he came slowly down the steps .`` Clay '' , he said , `` where are we goin '' ? ?`` To a ranch in the valley .There's someone there I have to see .We may take her with us -- to California .I don't know yet , it's crazy ; ;I have to think about it .But California is where we're goin '' .`` California '' .Gavin began to nod .`` That's a new land .A man could make a mark there .Two men , together like us , we could do somethin fine out there , maybe find a place where no one's ever been .Start out fresh , the two of us , like nothin had ever happened '' .`` Yes , like a father and son '' .`` I made you what you are '' , Gavin whispered .`` I made you so you could stand up .I made you a man '' .`` Yes , Gavin , you did '' .He approached the horse and laid a hand on the stallion's quivering neck .`` Help me up , Clay .Help me up , I feel kind of stiff '' .Clayton lifted him gently into the saddle , like a child .`` I hate to leave my garden '' , Gavin said .`` They'll trample it down .I loved my garden '' .`` It will grow again -- in California '' .`` I loved this valley '' , he whispered huskily .`` Lived alone here for three years , before any man came .Lived alone by the river .It was nice then , so peaceful and quiet .There was no one but me .I don't want to leave it '' .Clayton swung into the saddle and whacked the stallion's rump .The two horses broke from the yard , from the circle of light cast by the lamp still burning in the house , into the darkness .Thirty-fivethey rode at a measured pace through the valley .Dawn would come soon and the night was at its coldest .The moon had sunk below the black crest of the mountains and the land , seen through eyes that had grown accustomed to the absence of light , looked primeval , as if no man had ever trespassed before .It looked as Gavin had first seen it years ago , on those nights when he slept alone by his campfire and waked suddenly to the hoot of an owl or the rustle of a blade of grass in the moon's wind -- a savage land , untenanted and brooding , too strong to be broken by the will of men .Gavin sighed bitterly .In that inert landscape the caravan of his desires passed before his mind .He saw them ambushed , strewn in the postures of the broken and the dying .In vain his mind groped to reassemble the bones of the relationships he had sought so desperately , but they would not come to life .The silence oppressed him , made him bend low over the horse's neck as if to hide from a wind that had begun to blow far away and was twisting slowly through the darkness in its slow search .They passed ranches that were framed dark gray against the black hills .Then at last the darkness began to dissolve .A bold line of violet broke loose from the high ridge of the mountains , followed by feathers of red that swept the last stars from the sky .The wan light spread over the ground and the valley revealed in the first glimmer the contours of trees and fences and palely shadowed gullies .They had been seen as soon as they left the ranch , picked out of the darkness by the weary though watchful eyes of two men posted a few hundred yards away in the windless shelter of the trees .The two men whipped their horses into town and flung themselves up the steps of the saloon , crying their intelligence .The men in Pettigrew's were tired from a night's drinking , their faces red and baggy .But the liquor had flushed their courage .They greeted the news angrily , as though they had been cheated of purpose .Lester heard their muttering , saw their eyes reveal their desire .He worked his tongue round and round in the hollow of his cheek and his voice came out of his throat , dry and cracked .`` He's leavin .That's what you wanted , isn't it ? ?Clayton is with him , takin him out of the valley .You can't '' --`` Keep out of this '' , Purvis snarled .`` He's not your brother , he's Gavin's son .You see , he lied to us when he said he was leavin alone '' .Joe Purvis was thinking back many years .First he thought of the time he had ridden to Gavin and told him how his cattle were being rustled at the far end of the valley .He remembered Gavin's smirk , his own cringing feeling , his impotence .Then he thought of a time when Clayton's horse had fallen lame in the Gap .His wife had said to him : `` Nellie is in love with Clayton Roy .He wouldn't even dance with her at Gavin's party .He treats her like she was dirt .And you stand by like a fool and let him do it ''He remembered Clayton's mocking smile in the saloon when he had asked him what he would do if they brought their cattle to water .It was the night Clayton had tricked them in the poker game .`` You're Gavin's son '' , Joe Purvis had said .He turned to Lester .`` You brought him back to this valley thinkin he would help you find your boy .He meant to help Gavin all the time .He made a fool of you , Lester '' .He swung round to the other men -- `` We can catch him easy ! !There are plenty of fresh horses halfway at my place .If we let them go , they won't stay away , they'll find men to ride with them and they'll be back .There's only one way they can get out now and that's through the Gap -- if we ride hard we can take them '' .Lester's hand fluttered to Cabot's shoulder .The boy jerked away .`` He killed Tom -- do you understand that '' ? ?Cabot turned back to the men and he was drunk with the thing they would do , wild to break from the cloying warmth of the saloon into the cold of the ebbing night .He fled through the door and down the steps , running , and the men grunted and followed , pushing Lester to one side where he backed against the wall with the sleeve of his jacket raised before his eyes to shut out the light .Purvis and Silas Pettigrew were the last to leave .They mounted up and rode slowly behind the others at a safe distance .Thirty-sixin the cold dawn the mist swirled low to the ground , then rose with a gust of sudden wind to leave the valley clear .The clouds parted and hard gashes of sunlight swooped down to stain the earth with streaks of white and gold light so that the shadows of the running horses flowed like dark streams over the dazzling snow .When they turned in the saddle they could see the men behind them , strung out on the prairie in a flat black line .The wind of their running was cold and wild , the horses were lathered and their manes streamed like stiff black pennants in the wind .The mare began to tire and Clayton felt the spray of snow from the hoofs of Gavin's stallion .He looked over his shoulder at the thin dotting of pursuers .They neither gained nor fell back .He rode low on the mare's neck .Ahead of him Gavin turned slightly off the trail and pointed for the Gap , no more than a mile away .Gavin's face was bloodless with excitement .He did not look back ; ;he could feel more than hear the staccato beat of hoofs that fanned out across the prairie to the north .He knew who was riding after him -- the men he had known all his life , the men who had worked for him , sworn their loyalty to him .Now they were riding to kill him .And he was fleeing , running -- fleeing his death and his life at the same time .The land over which he sped was the land he had created and lived in : his valley .With every leaping stride of the horse beneath him he crossed one more patch of earth that had been his , that he would never see again .The Gap looming before him -- the place where had confronted Jack English on that day so many years ago -- was his exit from all that had meaning to him .California is too far , he thought .He would never reach California .He was too old -- when he passed up and through the corridor of pines that lined the trail he could see ahead , he was passing from life .Critically invisible , modern revolt , like X-rays and radioactivity , is perceived only by its effects at more materialistic social levels , where it is called delinquency .`` Disaffiliation '' , by the way , is the term used by the critic and poet , Lawrence Lipton , who has written several articles on this subject , the first of which , in The Nation , quoted as Epigraph : `` We disaffiliate .'' -- John L. Lewis .Like the pillars of Hercules , like two ruined Titans guarding the entrance to one of Dante's circles , stand two great dead juvenile delinquents -- the heroes of the post-war generation : the great saxophonist , Charlie Parker , and Dylan Thomas .If the word deliberate means anything , both of them certainly deliberately destroyed themselves .Both of them were overcome by the horror of the world in which they found themselves , because at last they could no longer overcome that world with the weapon of a purely lyrical art .Both of them were my friends .Living in San Francisco I saw them seldom enough to see them with a perspective which was not distorted by exasperation or fatigue .So as the years passed , I saw them each time in the light of an accelerated personal conflagration .The last time I saw Bird , at Jimbo's Bob City , he was so gone -- so blind to the world -- that he literally sat down on me before he realized I was there .`` What happened , man '' ? ?I said , referring to the pretentious `` Jazz Concert '' .`` Evil , man , evil '' , he said , and that's all he said for the rest of the night .About dawn he got up to blow .The rowdy crowd chilled into stillness and the fluent melody spiraled through it .The last time I saw Dylan , his self-destruction had not just passed the limits of rationality .It had assumed the terrifying inertia of inanimate matter .Being with him was like being swept away by a torrent of falling stones .Now Dylan Thomas and Charlie Parker have a great deal more in common than the same disastrous end .As artists , they were very similar .They were both very fluent .But this fluent , enchanting utterance had , compared with important artists of the past , relatively little content .Neither of them got very far beyond a sort of entranced rapture at his own creativity .The principal theme of Thomas's poetry was the ambivalence of birth and death -- the pain of blood-stained creation .Music , of course , is not so explicit an art , but anybody who knew Charlie Parker knows that he felt much the same way about his own gift .Both of them did communicate one central theme : Against the ruin of the world , there is only one defense -- the creative act .This , of course , is the theme of much art -- perhaps most poetry .It is the theme of Horace , who certainly otherwise bears little resemblance to Parker or Thomas .The difference is that Horace accepted his theme with a kind of silken assurance .To Dylan and Bird it was an agony and terror .I do not believe that this is due to anything especially frightful about their relationship to their own creativity .I believe rather that it is due to the catastrophic world in which that creativity seemed to be the sole value .Horace's column of imperishable verse shines quietly enough in the lucid air of Augustan Rome .Art may have been for him the most enduring , orderly , and noble activity of man .But the other activities of his life partook of these values .They did not actively negate them .Dylan Thomas's verse had to find endurance in a world of burning cities and burning Jews .He was able to find meaning in his art as long as it was the answer to air raids and gas ovens .As the world began to take on the guise of an immense air raid or gas oven , I believe his art became meaningless to him .I think all this could apply to Parker just as well , although , because of the nature of music , it is not demonstrable -- at least not conclusively .Thomas and Parker have more in common than theme , attitude , life pattern .In the practice of their art , there is an obvious technical resemblance .Contrary to popular belief , they were not great technical innovators .Their effects are only superficially startling .Thomas is a regression from the technical originality and ingenuity of writers like Pierre Reverdy or Apollinaire .Similarly , the innovations of bop , and of Parker particularly , have been vastly overrated by people unfamiliar with music , especially by that ignoramus , the intellectual jitterbug , the jazz aficionado .The tonal novelties consist in the introduction of a few chords used in classical music for centuries .And there is less rhythmic difference between progressive jazz , no matter how progressive , and Dixieland , than there is between two movements of many conventional symphonies .What Parker and his contemporaries -- Gillespie , Davis , Monk , Roach ( Tristano is an anomaly ) , etc. -- did was to absorb the musical ornamentation of the older jazz into the basic structure , of which it then became an integral part , and with which it then developed .This is true of the melodic line which could be put together from selected passages of almost anybody -- Benny Carter , Johnny Hodges .It is true of the rhythmic pattern in which the beat shifts continuously , or at least is continuously sprung , so that it becomes ambiguous enough to allow the pattern to be dominated by the long pulsations of the phrase or strophe .This is exactly what happened in the transition from baroque to rococo music .It is the difference between Bach and Mozart .It is not a farfetched analogy to say that this is what Thomas did to poetry .The special syntactical effects of a Rimbaud or an Edith Sitwell -- actually ornaments -- become the main concern .The metaphysical conceits , which fascinate the Reactionary Generation still dominant in backwater American colleges , were embroideries .Thomas's ellipses and ambiguities are ends in themselves .The immediate theme , if it exists , is incidental , and his main theme -- the terror of birth -- is simply reiterated .This is one difference between Bird and Dylan which should be pointed out .Again , contrary to popular belief , there is nothing crazy or frantic about Parker either musically or emotionally .His sinuous melody is a sort of naive transcendence of all experience .Emotionally it does not resemble Berlioz or Wagner ; ;it resembles Mozart .This is true also of a painter like Jackson Pollock .He may have been eccentric in his behavior , but his paintings are as impassive as Persian tiles .Partly this difference is due to the nature of verbal communication .The insistent talk-aboutiveness of the general environment obtrudes into even the most idyllic poetry .It is much more a personal difference .Thomas certainly wanted to tell people about the ruin and disorder of the world .Parker and Pollock wanted to substitute a work of art for the world .Technique pure and simple , rendition , is not of major importance , but it is interesting that Parker , following Lester Young , was one of the leaders of the so-called saxophone revolution .In modern jazz , the saxophone is treated as a woodwind and played with conventional embouchure .Metrically , Thomas's verse was extremely conventional , as was , incidentally , the verse of that other tragic enrage , Hart Crane .I want to make clear what I consider the one technical development in the first wave of significant post-war arts .Ornament is confabulation in the interstices of structure .A poem by Dylan Thomas , a saxophone solo by Charles Parker , a painting by Jackson Pollock -- these are pure confabulations as ends in themselves .Confabulation has come to determine structure .Uninhibited lyricism should be distinguished from its exact opposite -- the sterile , extraneous invention of the corn-belt metaphysicals , or present blight of poetic professors .Just as Hart Crane had little influence on anyone except very reactionary writers -- like Allen Tate , for instance , to whom Valery was the last word in modern poetry and the felicities of an Apollinaire , let alone a Paul Eluard were nonsense -- so Dylan Thomas's influence has been slight indeed .In fact , his only disciple -- the only person to imitate his style -- was W. S. Graham , who seems to have imitated him without much understanding , and who has since moved on to other methods .Thomas's principal influence lay in the communication of an attitude -- that of the now extinct British romantic school of the New Apocalypse -- Henry Treece , J. F. Hendry , and others -- all of whom were quite conventional poets .Parker certainly had much more of an influence .At one time it was the ambition of every saxophone player in every high school band in America to blow like Bird .Even before his death this influence had begun to ebb .In fact , the whole generation of the founding fathers of bop -- Gillespie , Monk , Davis , Blakey , and the rest -- are just now at a considerable discount .The main line of development today goes back to Lester Young and by-passes them .The point is that many of the most impressive developments in the arts nowadays are aberrant , idiosyncratic .There is no longer any sense of continuing development of the sort that can be traced from Baudelaire to Eluard , or for that matter , from Hawthorne through Henry James to Gertrude Stein .The cubist generation before World War 1 , , and , on a lower level , the surrealists of the period between the wars , both assumed an accepted universe of discourse , in which , to quote Andre Breton , it was possible to make definite advances , exactly as in the sciences .I doubt if anyone holds such ideas today .Continuity exits , but like the neo-swing music developed from Lester Young , it is a continuity sustained by popular demand .In the plastic arts , a very similar situation exists .Surrealists like Hans Arp and Max Ernst might talk of creation by hazard -- of composing pictures by walking on them with painted soles , or by tossing bits of paper up in the air .But it is obvious that they were self-deluded .Nothing looks anything like an Ernst or an Arp but another Ernst or Arp .Nothing looks less like their work than the happenings of random occasion .Many of the post-World War 2 , abstract expressionists , apostles of the discipline of spontaneity and hazard , look alike , and do look like accidents .The aesthetic appeal of pure paint laid on at random may exist , but it is a very impoverished appeal .Once again what has happened is an all-consuming confabulation of the incidentals , the accidents of painting .It is curious that at its best , the work of this school of painting -- Mark Rothko , Jackson Pollock , Clyfford Still , Robert Motherwell , Willem De-Kooning , and the rest -- resembles nothing so much as the passage painting of quite unimpressive painters : the mother-of-pearl shimmer in the background of a Henry McFee , itself a formula derived from Renoir ; ;the splashes of light and black which fake drapery in the fashionable imitators of Hals and Sargent .Often work of this sort is presented as calligraphy -- the pure utterance of the brush stroke seeking only absolute painteresque values .You have only to compare such painting with the work of , say , Sesshu , to realize that someone is using words and brushes carelessly .At its best the abstract expressionists achieve a simple rococo decorative surface .Its poverty shows up immediately when compared with Tiepolo , where the rococo rises to painting of extraordinary profundity and power .A Tiepolo painting , however confabulated , is a universe of tensions in vast depths .A Pollock is an object of art -- bijouterie -- disguised only by its great size .In fact , once the size is big enough to cover a whole wall , it turns into nothing more than extremely expensive wallpaper .Now there is nothing wrong with complicated wallpaper .There is just more to Tiepolo .The great Ashikaga brush painters painted wallpapers , too -- at least portable ones , screens .A process of elimination which leaves the artist with nothing but the play of his materials themselves cannot sustain interest in either artist or public for very long .So , in the last couple of years , abstract expressionism has tended toward romantic suggestion -- indications of landscape or living figures .The many linguistic techniques for reducing the amount of dictionary information that have been proposed all organize the dictionary's contents around prefixes , stems , suffixes , etc. .A significant reduction in the voume of store information is thus realized , especially for a highly inflected language such as Russian .For English the reduction in size is less striking .This approach requires that : ( 1 ) each text word be separated into smaller elements to establish a correspondence between the occurrence and dictionary entries , and ( 2 ) the information retrieved from several entries in the dictionary be synthesized into a description of the particular word .The logical scheme used to accomplish the former influences the placement of information in the dictionary file .Implementation of the latter requires storage of information needed only for synthesis .We suggest the application of certain data-processing techniques as a solution to the problem .But first , we must define two terms so that their meaning will be clearly understood : form -- any unique sequence of alphabetic characters that can appear in a language preceded and followed by a space ; ;occurrence -- an instance of a form in text .We propose a method for selecting only dictionary information required by the text being translated and a means for passing the information directly to the occurrences in text .We accomplish this by compiling a list of text forms as text is read by the computer .A random-storage scheme , based on the spelling of forms , provides an economical way to compile this text-form list .Dictionary forms found to match forms in the text list are marked .A location in the computer store is also named for each marked form ; ;dictionary information about the form stored at this location can be retrieved directly by occurrences of the form in text .Finally , information is retrieved from the dictionary as required by stages of the translation process -- the grammatical description for sentence-structure determination , equivalent-choice information for semantic analysis , and target-language equivalents for output construction .The dictionary is a form dictionary , at least in the sense that complete forms are used as the basis for matching text occurrences with dictionary entries .Also , the dictionary is divided into at least two parts : the list of dictionary forms and the file of information that pertains to these forms .A more detailed description of dictionary operations -- text lookup and dictionary modification -- gives a clearer picture .Text lookup , as we will describe it , consists of three steps .The first is compiling a list of text forms , assigning an information cell to each , and replacing text occurrences with the information cell assigned to the form of each occurrence .For this step the computer memory is separated into three regions : cells in the W-region are used for storage of the forms in the text-form list ; ;cells in the X-region and Y region are reserved as information cells for text forms .When an occurrence Af is isolated during text reading , a random memory address Af , the address of a cell in the X-region , is computed from the form of Af .Let Af denote the form of Af .If cell Af has not previously been assigned as the information cell of a form in the text-form list , it is now assigned as the information cell of Af .The form itself is stored in the next available cells of the W-region , beginning in cell Af .The address Af and the number of cells required to store the form are written in Af ; ;the information cell Af is saved to represent the text occurrence .Text reading continues with the next occurrence .Let us assume that Af is identical to the form of an occurrence Af which preceded Af in the text .When this situation exists , the address Af will equal Af which was produced from Af .If Af was assigned as the information cell for Af , the routine can detect that Af is identical to Af by comparing Af with the form stored at location Af .The address Af is stored in the cell Af .When , as in this case , the two forms match , the address Af is saved to represent the occurrence Af .Text reading continues with the next occurrence .A third situation is possible .The formula for computing random addresses from the form of each occurrence will not give a distinct address for each distinct form .Thus , when more than one distinct form leads to a particular cell in the X-region , a chain of information cells must be created to accommodate the forms , one cell in the chain for each form .If Af leads to an address Af that is equal to the address computed from Af , even though Af does not match Af , the chain of information cells is extended from Af by storing the address of the next available cell in the Y-region , Af , in Af .The cell Af becomes the second information cell in the chain and is assigned as the information cell of Af .A third cell can be added by storing the address of another Y-cell in Af ; ;similarly , as many cells are added as are required .Each information cell in the chain contains the address of the Y-cell where the form to which it is assigned is stored .Each cell except the last in the chain also contains the address of the Y-cell that is the next element of the chain ; ;the absence of such a link in the last cell indicates the end of the chain .Hence , when the address Af is computed from Af , the cell Af and all Y-cells in its chain must be inspected to determine whether Af is already in the form list or whether it should be added to the form list and the chain .When the information cell for Af has been determined , it is saved as a representation of Af .Text reading continues with the next occurrence .Text reading is terminated when a pre-determined number of forms have been stored in the text-form list .This initiates the second step of glossary lookup -- connecting the information cell of forms in the text-form list to dictionary forms .Each form represented by the dictionary is looked up in the text-form list .Each time a dictionary form matches a text form , the information cell of the matching text form is saved .The number of dictionary forms skipped since the last one matched is also saved .These two pieces of information for each dictionary form that is matched by a text form constitute the table of dictionary usage .If each text form is marked when matched with a dictionary form , the text forms not contained in the dictionary can be identified when all dictionary forms have been read .The appropriate action for handling these forms can be taken at that time .Each dictionary form is looked up in the text-form list by the same method used to look up a new text occurrence in the form list during text reading .A random address Af that lies within the X-region of memory mentioned earlier is computed from the i-th dictionary form .If cell Af is an information cell , it and any information cells in the Y-region that have been linked to Af each contain an address in the W-region where a potentially matching form is stored .The dictionary form is compared with each of these text forms .When a match is found , an entry is made in the table of dictionary usage .If cell Af is not an information cell we conclude that the i-th dictionary form is not in the text list .These two steps essentially complete the lookup operation .The final step merely uses the table of dictionary usage to select the dictionary information that pertains to each form matched in the text-form list , and uses the list of information cells recorded in text order to attach the appropriate information to each occurrence in text .The list of text forms in the W-region of memory and the contents of the information cells in the X and Y-regions are no longer required .Only the assignment of the information cells is important .The first stage of translation after glossary lookup is structural analysis of the input text .The grammatical description of each occurrence in the text must be retrieved from the dictionary to permit such an analysis .A description of this process will serve to illustrate how any type of information can be retrieved from the dictionary and attached to each text occurrence .The grammatical descriptions of all forms in the dictionary are recorded in a separate part of the dictionary file .The order is identical to the ordering of the forms they describe .When entries are being retrieved from this file , the table of dictionary usage indicates which entries to skip and which entries to store in the computer .This selection-rejection process takes place as the file is read .Each entry that is selected for storage is written into the next available cells of the Aj .The address of the first cell and the number of cells used is written in the information cell for the form .( The address of the information cell is also supplied by the table of dictionary usage .) When the complete file has been read , the grammatical descriptions for all text forms found in the dictionary have been stored in the W-region ; ;the information cell assigned to each text form contains the address of the grammatical description of the form it represents .Hence , the description of each text occurrence can be retrieved by reading the list of text-ordered information-cell addresses and outputting the description indicated by the information cell for each occurrence .The only requirements on dictionary information made by the text-lookup operation are that each form represented by the dictionary be available for lookup in the text-form list and that information for each form be available in a sequence identical with the sequence of the forms .This leaves the ordering of entries variable .( Here an entry is a form plus the information that pertains to it .)Two very useful ways for modifying a form-dictionary are the addition to the dictionary of complete paradigms rather than single forms and the application of a single change to more than one dictionary form .The former is intended to decrease the amount of work necessary to extend dictionary coverage .The latter is useful for modifying information about some or all forms of a word , hence reducing the work required to improve dictionary contents .Applying the techniques developed at Harvard for generating a paradigm from a representative form and its classification , we can add all forms of a word to the dictionary at once .An extension of the principle would permit entering a grammatical description of each form .Equivalents could be assigned to the paradigm either at the time it is added to the dictionary or after the word has been studied in context .Thus , one can think of a dictionary entry as a word rather than a form .If all forms of a paradigm are grouped together within the dictionary , a considerable reduction in the amount of information required is possible .For example , the inflected forms of a word can be represented , insofar as regular inflection allows , by a stem and a set of endings to be attached .( Indeed , the set of endings can be replaced by the name of a set of endings .) The full forms can be derived from such information just prior to the lookup of the form in the text-form list .Similarly , if the equivalents for the forms of a word do not vary , the equivalents need be entered only once with an indication that they apply to each form .The dictionary system is in no way dependent upon such summarization or designed around it .When irregularity and variation prevent summarizing , information is written in complete detail .Entries are summarized only when by doing so the amount of information retained in the dictionary is reduced and the time required for dictionary operations is decreased .Special districts in Rhode island .It is not within the scope of this report to elaborate in any great detail upon special districts in Rhode Island .However , a word should be mentioned in regard to them as independent units of government .There are forty-seven special district governments in Rhode Island ( excluding two regional school districts , four housing authorities , and the Kent County Water Authority ) .These forty-seven special purpose governments have the authority to levy taxes , to borrow money , own property , sue and be sued , and in general to exercise normal corporate powers .Unlike cities and towns , however , they do not have to submit any financial statements to the state Bureau of Audits .It is not an exaggeration to say that the state government has little or no fiscal control over these units of government .In addition to the collection of service charges , the special districts levy annual property taxes of approximately $450,000 .Fiscal years in other statescomparative data .A review of practices in other states regarding fiscal uniformity is pertinent to this report .Included in the findings are : 1 .Forty-six states , including Rhode Island , end their fiscal year on June 30 .The other four states end on varying dates : Alabama ( Sept. 30 ) , New York ( March 31 ) , Pennsylvania ( May 31 ) , and Texas ( August 31 ) .2 .In sixteen states , the fiscal year ending of the cities ( June 30 ) is the same as that of the state : Alaska , Arizona , California , Delaware , Massachusetts , Montana , Nevada , New Mexico , North Carolina , North Dakota , Oklahoma , Oregon , Vermont , West Virginia , Wyoming , and Hawaii ) .3 .In eleven states , the fiscal year of the cities ends on December 31 , while the state fiscal year ends on June 30 ( Arkansas , Colorado , Indiana , Kansas , New Hampshire , New Jersey , Ohio , South Dakota , Utah , Washington , and Wisconsin ) .4 .In eight states whose fiscal years close on June 30 , a majority of their cities close their fiscal year on December 31 : :( Georgia , Iowa , Kentucky , Maine , Maryland , Minnesota , Virginia , and South Carolina ) .5 .One state , Alabama , closes its fiscal year on September 30 , and all cities in the state , with one exception , also close fiscal years on September 30 .6 .Mississippi closes its fiscal year on June 30 , while all of its cities close their fiscal years on September 30 .7 .Pennsylvania closes its fiscal year on May 31 .All of its cities close their fiscal years on December 31 .The remaining twelve states have varying fiscal years for the state , city and local governments .However , only Illinois , Oregon , Louisiana and Rhode Island have a situation in which the sundry units of government vary widely in relation to fiscal uniformity .Fiscal uniformity : advantages and disadvantagesadvantages .An excellent summary of advantages concerning the uniform fiscal year and coordinated fiscal calendars was contained in a paper presented by a public finance authority recently .He listed among the values of fiscal uniformity : 1 .The uniform fiscal year requires compliance with common sense administration of local finances : adoption of the budget , or financial plan , in advance of spending .2 .The uniform fiscal year ensures conformance with another common sense rule , that of having cash in the bank before checks are drawn .It enables towns to make more economical purchases and to take advantage of cash discounts .3 .The uniform fiscal year promotes more careful budgeting and strengthens control over expenditures .By fixing the tax rate in advance of spending , upper limits are set on expenditures .4 .The uniform fiscal year brings the town's fiscal year into line with that of the schools , which expend the largest share of local disbursements .This greatly simplifies the town's bookkeeping and financial reporting .5 .The uniform fiscal year eliminates interest charges on money borrowed in the form of tax anticipation notes .Furthermore , tax collections not immediately needed for current expenditures may be invested in short-term treasury notes , augmenting the town's miscellaneous revenues and reducing the tax levy .6 .The uniform fiscal year facilitates inter-town comparison of revenues and expenditures .When towns have the same fiscal year it is relatively easy to make meaningful comparisons ; ;and as the cost of local government increases , the demand for such comparison also increases .Towns having different fiscal years are difficult to compare .Of all advantages , probably none is more important than the elimination of tax anticipation notes .Borrowing in anticipation of current taxes and other revenues is a routine procedure of the majority of municipalities at all times .It may be by bank loans , sale of notes or warrants , or by the somewhat casual method of issuance and registration of warrants .In any event it is a form of borrowing which could be and should be rendered unnecessary .Its elimination would result in the saving of interest costs , heavy when short-term money rates are high , and in freedom from dependence on credit which is not always available when needed most .This type of borrowing can be reduced to a minimum if quarterly installment payment of taxes is instituted and the first payment placed near the opening of the fiscal year .Any approach toward such a system looks toward saving and security .It should be noted that there are other and equally important reasons for establishing meaningful intergovernmental reporting bases on a uniform fiscal year .Both the federal and state governments commence their fiscal years on July 1 .Both units of government contribute increasingly large sums of money to the several local governments in this state as indicated below :It has been said that when local government revenues were mostly produced locally from the property tax , the lack of a uniform fiscal year was no great handicap ; ;but with the growth of state and federal fiscal aid , the emphasis on equalization , and the state-local sharing of responsibility for certain important functions , this is no longer true .The haphazard fiscal year calendar is an obstacle to the planning of clear and efficient state-local revenue and expenditure relationships .Disadvantages .Although there are many sound reasons for adopting uniform and coordinated fiscal years in Rhode Island , there are also certain difficulties encountered .These involve more the mechanics employed in adjusting to fiscal uniformity than they do actual disadvantages to the principle .One problem is a matter of shifting dates ; ;the other , is how to finance the transition .Little can be done about the changing of dates .This is an inherent part of adjusting fiscal calendars .It usually means a confused and disgruntled tax-paying public for a period of time .But cooperation and understanding between local officials and the citizenry help lessen this problem .The other problem is the matter of financing the transition period in the several cities and towns .This will be covered more fully later .It should be kept in mind that the ease or difficulty with which a town or city can convert to the proposed plan is directly dependent upon the financial condition of that town or city .Fortunately , there are no cities or towns in the state , with one or two possible exceptions that are in too difficult a position to finance the proposed change .Sacrifice will have to be made in some cases , but it is to the municipality's advantage to finance the change-over for a short period of time rather than pay interest on tax anticipation notes indefinitely .Adjusting the fiscal calendarsThe advantages of a uniform fiscal year and well synchronized fiscal and tax collection calendars are sufficiently great for Rhode Island municipalities to exert effort to secure them .The type of program desired can be determined by the nature and extent of the adjustments needed .Two features are immediately evident .First , the present situation is too varied to be systematized by any single formula .Second , the shift to a uniform July 1 to June 30 fiscal year will , of itself , improve the tax collection calendars of the great majority of cities and towns .There are at least two problems to consider : one is a matter of adjusting the fiscal calendar ; ;the other is how to finance the adjustments when necessary .The latter matter is considered in detail in a later section .Twelve cities and towns in Rhode Island presently indicate some plans to establish a uniform and coordinated fiscal tax year calendar .Plans vary from the `` talking stage '' to establishing special committees to accomplish this end .What is important here is that many of the cities and towns recognize the need for improved fiscal practices and are taking the initiative to obtain them .An analysis of the fiscal tax collection year calendars throughout the state indicates that transition may not be as painful as is commonly thought .However , it must be stressed that much depends upon the financial condition of the individual cities and towns involved .The adjustments needed to establish a uniform and coordinated fiscal tax collection year calendar throughout Rhode Island , based on a July 1 to June 30 year , are shown below .No adjustment needed .Six cities and towns are presently on a July 1 to June 30 fiscal year and have coordinated their tax collection year with it .No change is required for these towns .These municipalities include : Barrington , Lincoln , Middletown , Newport , North Kingstown , and South Kingstown .Adjustment of fiscal year .One town and one city , Coventry and East Providence , require an adjustment of their fiscal year only .This change will automatically adjust their tax collection year calendar so as to make all tax installments due and payable in the fiscal year collectible within that year .Adjustment of tax collection year .Six cities and towns are now on a July 1 to June 30 fiscal year and will need only to adjust their tax collection year calendar to establish uniformity .These cities and towns include Bristol , Glocester , Pawtucket , Cumberland , Central Falls , and Woonsocket .Simultaneous adjustments .Two cities to be considered , Providence and Cranston , are an enigma .Both have excellent integration of their fiscal tax collection year calendars .However , neither of these two cities is on the desired July 1 to June 30 fiscal year .The adjustment to a uniform and coordinated fiscal period could be accomplished relatively easily for them .In that both cities end their fiscal years on September 30 , they could levy taxes for an interim period of nine months , commencing with September 30 and ending with June 30 .These three installment dates would be : October 26 , January 26 , and April 25 ( Providence ) and November 15 , February 16 and May 15 ( Cranston ) .Both would start their new fiscal year on July 1 .Their tax collection calendar could then be : July 25 , October 26 , January 26 , and April 25 , ( Providence ) ; ;and August 15 , November 15 , February 17 , and May 15 , ( Cranston ) .Under this plan both Cranston and Providence would be on the uniform fiscal year but would still be using the same installment periods .Varying adjustments .The remaining twenty-three towns have fiscal years which end prior to June 30 .All of these towns will require adjustments of both their fiscal and tax collection years .Assuming an adjustment to the July 1 to June 30 fiscal year , the required adjustment of the tax collection years and the towns involved are shown in Table 3 .Methods of financing adjustmentsAside from the matter of adjusting the fiscal and tax calendars , there is the problem of financing the adjustment when this is necessary .It should be emphasized strongly that adjustments in fiscal dates or adoption of interim budgets do not necessarily mean financing over and above normal governmental requirements .In many communities there is simply no financial problem ; ;it is only a matter of adjusting accounting methods , careful fiscal planning and management , or some like combination of techniques .In other municipalities the difficulties in overcoming the financial burden have been sufficiently great to dishearten proponents of fiscal year changes .Fortunately , such cases in Rhode Island are more the exception than the rule .As shown earlier in Table 1 , the several cities and towns use widely varied fiscal and tax collection calendars .In addition , no two Rhode Island communities are identical in relation to their over-all financial condition .These factors practically insure that no single financing formula is feasible ; ;each situation must be studied and a plan developed that takes into consideration such factors as the effect of the existing and prospective tax calendars , the financial condition of the treasuries , and the length of the transition interval .Suitable plans range from those that are very easy to develop to those that are difficult to formulate and require borrowing ranging from short-term serial notes to long-term bonds .The financial problem , where it exists , usually stems from the adoption of a budget for the transitional or adjustment period .For those communities which have financial difficulties in effecting adjustments , there are a number of alternatives any one of which alone , or in combination with others , would minimize if not even eliminate the problem .There are more stems per item in Athabascan , which expresses the fact that the Athabascan languages have undergone somewhat more change in diverging from proto-Athabascan than the Yokuts languages from proto-Yokuts .This may be because the Athabascan divergence began earlier ; ;or again because the Athabascan languages spread over a very much larger territory ( including three wholly separated areas ) ; ;or both .The differentiation , however , is not very much greater , as shown by the fact that Athabascan shows 3.46 stems per meaning slot as against 2.75 for Yokuts , with a slightly greater number of languages represented in our sample : 24 as against 21 .( On deduction of one-eighth from 3.46 , the stem  item rate becomes 3.03 against 2.75 in equivalent number of languages .) These general facts are mentioned to make clear that the total situation in the two families is similar enough to warrant comparison .The greatest difference in the two sets of figures is due to differences in the two sets of lists used .These differences in turn result from the fact that my Yokuts vocabularies were built up of terms selected mainly to insure unambiguity of English meaning between illiterate informants and myself , within a compact and uniform territorial area , but that Hoijer's vocabulary is based on Swadesh's second glottochronological list which aims at eliminating all items which might be culturally or geographically determined .Swadesh in short was trying to develop a basic list that was universal ; ;I , one that was specifically adapted to the San Joaquin Valley .The result is that I included 70 animal names , but Swadesh only 4 ; ;and somewhat similarly for plants , 16 as against 4 .Swadesh , and therefore Hoijer , felt compelled to omit all terms denoting species or even genera ( ox , vulture , salmon , yellow pine , manzanita ) ; ;their classes of animal and plant terms are restricted to generalizations or recurrent parts ( fish , bird , tree , grass , horn , tail , bark , root ) .The groups are therefore really non-comparable in content as well as in size .Other classes are included only by myself ( interrogatives , adverbs ) or only by Swadesh and Hoijer ( pronouns , demonstratives ) .What we have left as reasonably comparable are four classes : ( 1 ) body parts and products , which with a proportionally nearly even representation ( 51 terms out of 253 , 25 out of 100 ) come out with nearly even ratios ; ;2.6 and 2.7 ; ;( 2 ) Nature ( 29 terms against 17 ) , ratios 3.3 versus 4.1 ; ;( 3 ) adjectives ( 16 , 15 terms ) , ratios 3.9 versus 4.7 ; ;( 4 ) verbs ( 9 , 22 terms ) , ratios 4.0 versus 3.4 .It will be seen that where the scope is similar , the Athabascan ratios come out somewhat higher ( as indeed they ought to with a total ratio of 2.8 as against 3.5 or 4 : 5 ) except for verbs , where alone the Athabascan ratio is lower .This exception may be connected with Hoijer's use of a much higher percentage of verbs : 22% of his total list as against 3.5% in mine .Or the exception may be due to a particular durability peculiar to the Athabascan verb .More word class ratios determined in more languages will no doubt ultimately answer the question .5 .If word classes differ in their resistance or liability to stem replacement within meaning slot , it is conceivable that individual meanings also differ with fair consistence trans-lingually .Hoijer's Athabascan and my Yokuts share 71 identical meanings ( with allowance for several near-synonyms like stomach-belly , big-large , long-far , many-much , die-dead , say-speak ) .For Yokuts , I tabulated these 71 items in five columns , according as they were expressed by 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and more than 4 stems .The totals for these five categories are not too uneven , namely 20 , 15 , 11 , 16 , 9 respectively .For Athabascan , with a greater range of stems , the first two of five corresponding columns were identical , 1 and 2 stems ; ;the three others had to be spread somewhat , and are headed respectively Af ; ;Af ; ;and Af stems .While the particular limits of these groupings may seem artificially arbitrary , they do fairly express a corresponding grouping of more variable material , and they eventuate also in five classes , along a similar scale , containing approximately equal numbers of cases , namely 19 , 14 , 15 , 11 , 12 in Athabascan .When now we count the frequency of the 71 items in the two language families appearing in the same column or grade , or one column or grade apart , or two or three or four , we find these differences : Af.This distribution can be summarized by averaging the distance in grades apart : Af ; ;which , divided by Af gives a mean of 1.07 grades apart .If the distribution of the 71 items were wholly concordant in the two families , the distance would of course be 0 .If it were wholly random and unrelated , it would be 2.0 , assuming the five classes were equal in n , which approximately they are .The actual mean of 1.07 being about halfway between 0 of complete correlation and 2.0 of no correlation , it is evident that there is a pretty fair degree of similarity in the behavior even of particular individual items of meaning as regards long-term stem displacement .6 .In 1960 , David D. Thomas published Basic Vocabulary In some Mon-Khmer Languages ( AL 2 , No. 3 , pp. 7 - 11 ) , which compares 8 Mon-Khmer languages with the I-E language data on which Swadesh based the revised retention rate ( Af ) in place of original ( Af ) , and his revised 100 word basic glottochronological list in Towards Greater Accuracy ( IJAL 21 : :121 - 137 ) .Thomas' findings are , first , `` that the individual items vary greatly and unpredictably in their persistence '' ; ;but , second , `` that the semantic groups are surprisingly unvarying in their average persistence '' ( as between M-K and I-E ) .His first conclusion , on behavior of individual items , is negative , whereas mine ( on Ath. and Yok. ) was partially positive .His second conclusion , on semantic word classes , agrees with mine .This second conclusion , independently arrived at by independent study of material from two pairs of language families as different and remote from one another as these four are , cannot be ignored .Thomas also presents a simple equation for deriving an index of persistence , which weights not only the number of stems ( ' roots ' ) per meaning , but their relative frequency .Thus his persistence values for some stem frequencies per meaning are : stem identical in 8 languages , 100% ; ;stem frequencies 7 and 1 , 86% ; ;stem frequencies 4 and 4 , 64% ; ;stem frequencies 4 , 3 , and 1 , 57% .His formula will have to be weighed , may be altered or improved , and it should be tested on additional bodies of material .But consideration of the frequency of stems per constant meaning seems to be established as having significance in comparative situations with diachronic and classificatory relevance ; ;and Gleason presumably is on the way with a further contribution in this area .As to relative frequencies of competing roots ( 7 - 1 vs. 4 - 4 , etc. ) , Thomas with his ' weighting ' seems to be the first to have considered the significance this might have .The problem needs further exploration .I was at least conscious of the distinction in my full Yokuts presentation that awaits publication , in which , in listing ' Two-Stem Meanings ' , I set off by asterisks those forms in which N of stem B was Af of stem A , the unasterisked ones standing for Af ; ;or under ' Four Stems ' , I set off by asterisks cases where the combined N of stems Af was Af .7 .These findings , and others which will in time be developed , will affect the method of glottochronological inquiry .If adjectival meanings show relatively low retentiveness of stems , as I am confident will prove to be the case in most languages of the world , why should our basic lists include 15 per cent of these unstable forms , but only 8 per cent of animals and plants which replace much more slowly ? ?Had Hoijer substituted for his 15 adjectival slots 15 good animal and plant items , his rate of stem replacement would have been lower and the age of Athabascan language separation smaller .And irrespective of the outcome in centuries elapsed since splitting , calculations obviously carry more concordant and comparable meaning if they deal with the most stable units than with variously unstable ones .It is evident that Swadesh has not only had much experience with basic vocabulary in many languages but has acquired great tact and feeling for the expectable behavior of lexical items .Why then this urge to include unstable items in his basic list ? ?It is the urge to obtain a list as free of geographical and cultural conditioning as possible .And why that insistence ? ?It is the hope of attaining a list of items of universal occurrence .But it is becoming increasingly evident that such a hope is a snare .Not that such a list cannot be constructed ; ;but the nearer it comes to attaining universality , the less significant will it be linguistically .Its terms will tend to be labile or vague , and they will fit actual languages more and more badly .The practical operational problem of lexicostatistics is the establishment of a basic list of items of meaning against which the particular forms or terms of languages can be matched as the medium of comparison .The most important quality of the meanings is that they should be as definable as possible .In proportion as meanings are concrete , we can better rely on their being insulated and distinctive .An elephant or a fox or a swan or a cocopalm or a banana possess in unusually high degree this quality of obvious , common-sense , indubitable identity , as do an eye or tooth or nail .They isolate out easily , naturally , and unambiguously from the continuum of nature and existence ; ;and they should be given priority in the basic list as long as they continue to show these qualities .With the universal list as his weapon , Swadesh has extended his march of conquest farther and farther into the past , eight , ten , twelve millennia back .And he has proclaimed greater or less affiliation between all Western hemisphere languages .Some of this may prove to be true , or even considerable of it , whether by genetic ramification or by diffusion and coalescence .But the farther out he moves , the thinner will be his hold on conclusive evidence , and the larger the speculative component in his inferences .He has traversed provinces and kingdoms , but he has not consolidated them behind him , nor does he control them .He has announced results on Hokan , Penutian , Uto-Aztecan , and almost all other American families and phyla , and has diagrammed their degree of interrelation ; ;but he has not worked out by lexicostatistics one comprehensively complete classification of even a single family other than Salish .That is his privilege .The remote , cloudy , possible has values of its own -- values of scope , stimulus , potential , and imagination .But there is also a firm aspect to lexicostatistics : the aspect of learning the internal organization of obvious natural genetic groups of languages as well as their more remote and elusive external links ; ;of classification first , with elapsed age merely a by-product ; ;of acquiring evidential knowledge of what happened in Athabascan , in Yokuts , in Uto-Aztecan in the last few thousand years as well as forecasting what more anciently may have happened between them .This involves step-by-step progress , and such will have to be the day-by-day work of lexicostatistics as a growing body of scientific inquiry .If of the founders of glottochronology Swadesh has escaped our steady plodding , and Lees has repudiated his own share in the founding , that is no reason why we should swerve .8 .There is no apparent reason why we should feel bound by Swadesh's rules and procedure since his predilections and aims have grown so vast .It seems time to consider a revision of operational procedures for lexicostatistic studies on a more humble , solid , and limited basis .I would propose , first , an abandonment of attempts at a universal lexical list , as intrinsically unachievable , and operationally inadequate in proportion as it is achieved .I would propose , next , as the prime requirement for constitution of new basic lists , items whose forms show as high an empirical retention rate as possible .There would be no conceivable sense in going to the opposite extreme of selecting items whose forms are the most unstable .An attempted middle course might lead to devices like a 5000-word alphabetized dictionary from which every fiftieth word was selected .Mr. Podger always particularly enjoyed the last night of each summer at Loon Lake .The narrow fringe of sadness that ran around it only emphasized the pleasure .The evening was not always spent in the same way .This year , on a night cool with the front of September moving in , but with plenty of summer still about , the Podgers were holding a neighborhood gathering in the Pod .The little cottage was bursting with people of all ages .In the midst of it all , Mr. Podger came out on the Pod porch , alone .He had that day attended a country auction , and he had come back with a prize .The prize was an old-fashioned , woven cloth hammock , complete with cross-top pillow , fringed side pieces , and hooks for hanging .Mrs. Podger had obligingly pushed things around on the porch to make room for it , and there it was , slung in a vine-shaded corner , the night breeze rippling its fringe with a slow , caressing movement .Mr. Podger sat down in it , pushed himself back and forth in one or two slow , rhythmic motions , and then swung his feet up into it .He closed his eyes and let the unintelligible drift of voices sweep pleasantly over him .Suddenly one young voice rose above the others .`` But '' , it said , `` do you always know when you're happy '' ? ?The voice sank back into the general tangle of sound , but the question stayed in Mr. Podger's mind .Here , in the cool , autumn-touched evening , Mr. Podger mentally retraced a day that had left him greatly contented and at peace .It had begun with the blue jay feather .Walking along the lake before breakfast , Mr. Podger had seen the feather , and the bird that had lost it in flight .The winging spread of blue had gone on , calling harshly , into the wood .The small shaft of blue had drifted down and come to rest at his feet .All day long Mr. Podger , who was a straw-hat man in the summer , had worn the feather in the band of his broad-brimmed sunshield .Would a blue feather in a man's hat make him happy all day ? ?Hardly .But it was something to have seen it floating down through the early morning sunshine , linking the blue of the sky with the blue of the asters by the lake .Then , since the auction was being held nearby , he had walked to it .And there , on the way , had been the box turtle , that slow , self-contained , world-ignoring relic of pre-history , bent , for reasons best known to itself , on crossing the road .It was doing very well , too , having reached the center , and was pursuing its way with commendable singleness of purpose when Mr. Podger saw hazard approaching in the shape of a flashy little sports car .Would the driver see the turtle ? ?Would he take pains to avoid it ? ?Mr. Podger took no chances .Taking off his hat and signaling the driver with it , Mr. Podger stepped into the road , lifted the surprised turtle and consummated its road-crossing with what must have been a breath-taking suddenness .The turtle immediately withdrew into its private council room to study the phenomenon .But Mr. Podger and the driver of the sports car waved at each other .Here in the cool darkness Mr. Podger could still feel the warmth of midday , could still see the yellow butterflies dancing over the road , could still see the friendly grin on the young , sun-browned face as the driver looked back over his shoulder for a moment before the car streaked out of sight .Where was the driver now ? ?What was he doing ? ?And the turtle ? ?Mr. Podger smiled .For a few brief minutes they had all been part of one little drama .The three would never meet again , but for some reason or other Mr. Podger was sure he would always remember the incident .Then there had been the auction itself .Mr. Podger heard again ; ;at will , the voice of the auctioneer , the voices of the bidders , and finally the small boy who had been so interested in Mr. Podger's hammock purchase .`` I like them things , too '' , he had said .`` We got one at home .You know what ? ?If you're lyin' out in the hammock at night , and it gets kinda cool -- you know -- you just take these sides with the fringe on -- see -- and wrap 'em right over you .I do it , lots o' times -- I like to lie in a hammock at night , by myself , when it's all quiet .The wind moves it a little bit -- you know .''Mr. Podger had thanked him gravely , and now he made use of the advice .As he pulled the fringed sides up and made himself into a cocoon , Mr. Podger saw that thin , attractive , freckled little face again , and hoped that the boy , too , was lying in a cool , fringed-wrapped quiet .Alacrity , the Podger cat , came by the hammock , rubbed her back briefly against it , and then , sure of a welcome , hopped up .She remarked that she found the night wind a little chilly , and Mr. Podger took her inside the fringe .Soon her purring rivaled the chirping of the tree crickets , rivaled the hum of voices from inside the Pod .Mr. Podger was just adding this to his pictures of the day when the screen door opened and Pam burst out .`` Dad '' ! !She said .`` It's getting so chilly we've lighted a fire , and we're going to tell a round robin story -- a nice , scary one .We need you to start it .Why are you out here all by yourself ? ?Aren't you happy '' ? ?Mr. Podger opened his cocoon and emerged , tucking Alacrity under his arm to bring her in by the fire .`` Of course I am '' , he said .`` Never happier in my life .I just came out here to know it '' .DallasAs the South begins another school year , national and even world attention is directed at the region's slow progress toward racial equality in the public schools .Desegregation is beginning in two more important Southern cities -- Dallas and Atlanta .In each city civic and education leaders have been working hard to get public opinion prepared to accept the inevitability of equal treatment .These programs emphasize the acceptance of biracial classrooms peacefully .The programs do not take sides on the issue itself .They point out simply that `` it is the law of the land '' .The two cities have the examples of Little Rock and New Orleans to hold up as warnings against resorting to violence to try to stop the processes of desegregation .Even better , they have the examples of Nashville and Houston to hold up as peaceful and progressive programs .In each case there was an initial act of violence .In Nashville , a school was dynamited .In Houston , there were a few incidents of friction between whites and Negroes , none of which were serious .In each city quick public reaction and fast action by the city government halted the threats of more serious incidents .The Nashville plan , incidentally , has become recognized as perhaps the most acceptable and thus the most practical to put into effect in the troubled South .It is a `` stair-step '' plan , in which desegregation begins in the first grade .Each year another grade is added to the process , until finally all 12 grades are integrated .The schedules are flexible so that the program can be accelerated as the public becomes more tolerant or realizes that it is something that has to be done , `` so why not now '' .The program has worked well in both Nashville and Houston .It met a serious rebuff in New Orleans , where the two schools selected for the first moves toward integration were boycotted by white parents .Another attempt will be made this year in New Orleans to resume the program .Generally , throughout the South , there is a growing impatience with the pattern of violence with which every step of desegregation is met .Perhaps the most eloquent move toward removal of racial barriers has been in Dallas .During the summer , Negroes began quietly patronizing previously segregated restaurants and lunch counters in downtown retail establishments .It was part of a citywide move toward full integration .So successful has been this program , worked out by white and Negro civic leaders , that further extensions are expected in the next few months .Hotels , for example , are ready to let down the bars .Already , at least one hotel has been quietly taking reservations on a nonracial basis .Several conventions have been held in recent months in hotels on a nonsegregated basis .This is a radical change in attitude from the conditions which prevailed several years ago , when a series of bombings was directed against Negroes who were moving into previously all-white neighborhoods of Dallas .It is also symptomatic of a change in attitude which appears to be spreading all across the South .Southern whites themselves are realizing that they had been wrong in using violence to try to stop Negroes from claiming equal rights .They insist they are ashamed of such violence and intimidation as occurred in Alabama when the Freedom Riders sought to break down racial discrimination in local bus depots .All across the South there are signs that racial violence is finding less approval among whites who themselves would never take active part but might once have shown a tolerant attitude toward it .There are many causes for this change .One of the most important is economic .Business leaders are aware now that they suffer greatly from any outbreak of violence .They are putting strong pressure on their police departments to keep order .In the past these same Southerners were inclined to look the other way .And as the businessmen have begun to act , a real sense of co-operation has sprung up .This co-operation has emboldened other Southern whites to add their voices to demands for peaceable accommodation .They realize that by acting in concert , rather than individually , they will not be picked out as objects of retaliation -- economic and otherwise .Since moving from a Chicago suburb to Southern California a few months ago , I've been introduced to a new game called Lanesmanship .Played mostly on the freeways around Los Angeles , it goes like this :A driver cruising easily at 70 m.p.h. in Lane A of a four-lane freeway spies an incipient traffic jam ahead .Traffic in the next lane appears to be moving more smoothly so he pokes a tentative fender into Lane B , which is heavily populated by cars also moving at 70 m.p.h. .The adjacent driver in Lane B has three choices open to him .He can ( 1 ) point his car resolutely at the invading fender and force the other driver back into Lane A ; ;( 2 ) slow down and permit the ambivalent driver to change lanes ; ;or ( 3 ) alternately accelerate and decelerate , thus keeping the first driver guessing as to his intentions , thereby making a fascinating sport of the whole affair .The really remarkable thing to me is that most California natives unhesitatingly elect to slow down and permit the invading car free access .Whether or not this is done out of enlightened self-preservation , I don't know .But it is done , consistently and I'm both surprised and impressed .This could never happen in my native Chicago .There such soggy acquiesence would be looked upon as a sure sign of deteriorating manhood .In Chicago , the driver cut out would likely jam his gas pedal to the floor in an effort to force the other car back .Failing this , he would pull alongside at the first opportunity and shake his fist threateningly .This negative explanation of courtesy on the freeways , however , does an injustice to Southern California drivers .At the risk of losing my charge-a-plate at Marshall Field and Company , I would like to challenge an old and hallowed stereotype .After three months of research , I can state unequivocally that Los Angeles drivers are considerably more courteous and competent than any other drivers I've ever encountered .During one recent day of driving about Los Angeles there were actually a dozen occasions when oncoming drivers stopped an entire lane of traffic to permit me to pull out of an impossible side street .A band viscometer is shown in Figure 2 .It consists of two blocks with flat surfaces held apart by shims .There is a small well in the top in which the fluid or paste to be tested is placed .A tape of cellulose acetate is pulled between the blocks and the tape pulls the fluid or paste with it between the parallel faces of the blocks .In normal use weights are hung on the end of the tape and allowed to pull the tape and the material to be tested between the blocks .After it has reached terminal velocity , the time for the tape to travel a known distance is recorded .By the use of various weights , data for a force-rate of shear graph can be obtained .The instrument used for this work was a slight modification of that previously described .In this test a Af tape was pulled between the blocks with a motor and pulley at a rate of Af with a clearance of 0.002'' '' on each side of the tape .This gives a rate of shear of Af .This , however , can only be considered approximate , as the diameter of the pulley was increased by the build-up of tape and the tape was occasionally removed from the pulley during the runs .The face of one block contained a hole 1 '' in diameter which led to a manometer for the measurement of the normal pressure .Although there were only four fluids tested , it was apparent that there were two distinct types .Two of the fluids showed a high-positive normal pressure when undergoing shear , and two showed small negative pressures which were negligible in comparison with the amount of the positive pressures generated by the other two .Figure 3 shows the data on a silicone fluid , labeled 12,500 cps which gave a high positive normal pressure .Although the tape was run for over 1 hr. , a steady state was not reached , and it was concluded that the reason for this was that the back pressure of the manometer was built up from the material fed from between the blocks and this was available at a very slow rate .A system had to be used which did not depend upon the feeding of the fluid into the manometer if measurements of the normal pressure were to be made in a reasonable time .A back pressure was then introduced , and the rise or fall of the material in the manometer indicated which was greater , the normal pressure in the block or the back pressure .By this method it was determined that the normal pressure exerted by a sample of polybutene ( molecular weight reported to be 770 ) was over half an atmosphere .The actual pressure was not determined because the pressure was beyond the upper limit of the apparatus on hand .The two fluids which gave the small negative pressures were polybutenes with molecular weights which were stated to be 520 and 300 .These are fluids which one would expect to be less viscoelastic or more Newtonian because of their lower molecular weight .The maximum suction was 3.25'' '' of test fluid measured from the top of the block , and steady states were apparently reached with these fluids .It is presumed that this negative head was associated with some geometric factor of the assembly , since different readings were obtained with the same fluid and the only apparent difference was the assembly and disassembly of the apparatus .This negative pressure is not explained by the velocity head Af since this is not sufficient to explain the readings by several magnitudes .These experiments can be considered exploratory only .However , they do demonstrate the presence of large normal pressures in the presence of flat shear fields which were forecast by the theory in the first part of the paper .They also give information which will aid in the design of a more satisfactory instrument for the measurement of the normal pressures .Such an instrument would be useful for the characterization of many commercial materials as well as theoretical studies .The elasticity is a parameter of fluids which is not subject to simple measurement at present , and it is a parameter which is probably varying in an unknown manner with many commercial materials .Such an instrument is expected to be especially useful if it could be used to measure the elasticity of heavy pastes such as printing inks , paints , adhesives , molten plastics , and bread dough , for the elasticity is related to those various properties termed `` length '' , `` shortness '' , `` spinnability '' , etc. , which are usually judged by subjective methods at present .The actual change Af caused by a shear field is calculated by multiplying the pressure differential times the volume , just as it is for any gravitational or osmotic pressure head .If the volume is the molal volume , then Af is obtained on a molal basis which is the customary terminology of the chemists .Although the Af calculation is obvious by analogy with that for gravitational field and osmotic pressure , it is interesting to confirm it by a method which can be generalized to include related effects .Consider a shear field with a height of H and a cross-sectional area of A opposed by a manometer with a height of H ( referred to the same base as H ) and a cross-sectional area of A .If Af is the change per unit volume in Gibbs function caused by the shear field at constant P and T , and **yr is the density of the fluid , then the total potential energy of the system above the reference height is Af .Af is the work necessary to fill the manometer column from the reference height to H .The total volume of the system above the reference height is Af , and H can be eliminated to obtain an equation for the total potential energy of the system in terms of H .The minimum total potential energy is found by taking the derivative with respect to H and equating to zero .This gives Af , which is the pressure .This is interesting for it combines both the thermodynamic concept of a minimum Gibbs function for equilibrium and minimum mechanical potential energy for equilibrium .This method can be extended to include the concentration differences caused by shear fields .The relation between osmotic pressure and the Gibbs function may also be developed in an analogous way .In the above development we have applied the thermodynamics of equilibrium ( referred to by some as thermostatics ) to the steady state .This can be justified thermodynamically in this case , and this will be done in a separate paper which is being prepared .This has an interesting analogy with the assumption stated by Philippoff that `` the deformational mechanics of elastic solids can be applied to flowing solutions '' .There is one exception to the above statement as has been pointed out , and that is that fluids can relax by flowing into fields of lower rates of shear , so the statement should be modified by stating that the mechanics are similar .If the mechanics are similar , we can also infer that the thermodynamics will also be similar .The concept of the strain energy as a Gibbs function difference Af and exerting a force normal to the shearing face is compatible with the information obtained from optical birefringence studies of fluids undergoing shear .Essentially these birefringence studies show that at low rates of shear a tension is present at 45-degrees to the direction of shear , and as the rate of shear increases , the direction of the maximum tension moves asymptotically toward the direction of shear .According to Philippoff , the recoverable shear S is given by Af where **yc is the angle of extinction .From this and the force of deformation it should be possible to calculate the elastic energy of deformation which should be equal to the Af calculated from the pressure normal to the shearing face .There is another means which should show the direction and relative value of the stresses in viscoelastic fluids that is not mentioned as such in the literature , and that is the shape of the suspended drops of low viscosity fluids in shear fields .These droplets are distorted by the normal forces just as a balloon would be pulled or pressed out of shape in one's hands .These droplets appear to be ellipsoids , and it is mathematically convenient to assume that they are .If they are not ellipsoids , the conclusions will be a reasonable approximation .The direction of the tension of minimum pressure is , of course , given by the direction of the major axis of the ellipsoids .Mason and Taylor both show that the major axis of the ellipsoids is at 45-degrees at low rates of shear and that it approaches the direction of shear with increased rates of shear .( Some suspensions break up before they are near to the direction of shear , and some become asymptotic to it without breakup .) This is , of course , a similar type of behavior to that indicated by birefringence studies .The relative forces can be calculated from the various radii of curvature if we assume : ( A ) The surface tension is uniform on the surface of the drop .( B ) That because of the low viscosity of the fluid , the internal pressure is the same in all directions .( C ) The kinetic effects are negligible .( D ) Since the shape of the drop conforms to the force field , it does not appreciably affect the distribution of forces in the fluid .These are reasonable assumptions with low viscosity fluids suspended in high viscosity fluids which are subjected to low rates of shear .Just as the pressure exerted by surface tension in a spherical drop is Af and the pressure exerted by surface tension on a cylindrical shape is Af , the pressure exerted by any curved surface is Af , where **yg is the interfacial tension and Af and Af are the two radii of curvature .This formula is given by Rumscheidt and Mason .If A is the major axis of an ellipsoid and B and C are the other two axes , the radius of curvature in the ab plane at the end of the axis Af , and the difference in pressure along the A and B axes is Af .There are no data published in the literature on the shape of low viscosity drops to confirm the above formulas .However , there are photographs of suspended drops of cyclohexanol phthalate ( viscosity 155 poises ) suspended in corn syrup of 71 poises in a paper by Mason and Bartok .This viscosity of the material in the drops is , of course , not negligible .Measurements on the photograph in this paper give Af at the maximum rate of shear of Af .If it is assumed that the formula given by Lodge of cosec Af applies , the pressure difference along the major axes can be calculated from the angle of inclination of the major axis , and from this the interfacial tension can be calculated .Its value was Af from the above data .This appears to be high , as would be expected from the appreciable viscosity of the material in the drops .It is appropriate to call attention to certain thermodynamic properties of an ideal gas that are analogous to rubber-like deformation .The internal energy of an ideal gas depends on temperature only and is independent of pressure or volume .In other words , if an ideal gas is compressed and kept at constant temperature , the work done in compressing it is completely converted into heat and transferred to the surrounding heat sink .This means that work equals Q which in turn equals Af .There is a well-known relationship between probability and entropy which states that Af , where **zq is the probability that state ( i.e. , volume for an ideal gas ) could be reached by chance alone .This is known as conformational entropy .This conformational entropy is , in this case , equal to the usual entropy , for there are no other changes or other energies involved .Note that though the ideal gas itself contains no additional energy , the compressed gas does exert an increased pressure .The energy for any isothermal work done by the perfect gas must come as thermal energy from its surroundings .A proton magnetic resonance study of polycrystalline Af as a function of magnetic field and temperature is presented .Af is paramagnetic , and electron paramagnetic dipole as well as nuclear dipole effects lead to line broadening .The lines are asymmetric and over the range of field Af gauss and temperature Af the asymmetry increases with increasing Af and decreasing T .An isotropic resonance shift of Af to lower applied fields indicates a weak isotropic hyperfine contact interaction .The general theory of resonance shifts is used to derive a general expression for the second moment Af of a polycrystalline paramagnetic sample and is specialized to Af .The theory predicts a linear dependence of Af on Af , where J is the experimentally determined Curie-Weiss constant .The experimental second moment Af conforms to the relation Af in agreement with theory .Hence , the electron paramagnetic effects ( slope ) can be separated from the nuclear effects ( intercept ) .The paramagnetic dipole effects provide some information on the particle shapes .The nuclear dipole effects provide some information on the motions of the hydrogen nuclei , but the symmetry of the Af bond in Af remains in doubt .Introductionthe magnetic moment of an unpaired electron associated nearby may have a tremendous influence on the magnetic resonance properties of nuclei .It is important to consider and experimentally verify this influence since quantitative nuclear resonance is becoming increasingly used in investigations of structure .Af appeared to be well suited for the study of these matters , since it is a normal paramagnet , with three unpaired electrons on the chromium , its crystal structure is very simple , and the unknown position of the hydrogen in the strong Af bond provides structural interest .We first discuss the Af bond in Af .We then outline the theory of the interaction of paramagnetic dipoles with nuclei and show that the theory is in excellent agreement with experiment .Indeed it is possible to separate electron paramagnetic from nuclear effects .The information provided by the electron paramagnetic effects is then discussed , and finally the nuclear effects are interpreted in terms of various motional-modified models of the Af bond in Af .Af bond in AfTheoretical studies of the hydrogen bond generally agree that the Af bond will be linear in the absence of peculiarities of packing in the solid .Moreover , it will be asymmetric until a certain critical Af distance is reached , below which it will become symmetric .There is ample evidence from many sources that the Af bond in Af is symmetric .The Af distance in Af is 2.26 Aj .There is evidence , though less convincing than for Af , that the Af bond in nickel dimethylglyoxime is symmetric .Here the Af distance is 2.44 Aj .A number of semiempirical estimates by various workers lead to the conclusion that the Af bond becomes symmetric when the Af bond length is about 2.4 to 2.5 A , but aside from the possible example of nickel dimethylglyoxime there have been no convincing reports of symmetric Af bonds .Douglass has studied the crystal structure of Af by x-ray diffraction .He finds the structure contains an Af bond with the Af distance of Af .There is , then , the possibility that this Af bond is symmetric , although Douglass was unable to determine its symmetry from his x-ray data .Douglass found Af to be trigonal , Laue symmetry Af , with Af , Af .X-ray and experimental density showed one formula unit in the unit cell , corresponding to a paramagnetic ion density of Af .The x-ray data did not permit Douglass to determine uniquely the space group , but a negative test for piezoelectricity led him to assume a center of symmetry .Under this assumption the space group must be Af and the following are the positions of the atoms in the unit cell .Af .This space group requires the hydrogen bond to be symmetric .Douglass found powder intensity calculations and measurements to agree best for Af .These data lead to a structure in which sheets of Cr atoms lie between two sheets of O atoms .The O atoms in each sheet are close packed and each Cr atom is surrounded by a distorted octahedron of O atoms .The Af layers are stacked normal to the ( 111 ) axis with the lower oxygens of one layer directly above the upper oxygens of the neighboring lower layer , in such a manner that the repeat is every three layers .The separate layers are joined together by hydrogen bonds .A drawing of the structure is to be found in reference 6 .The gross details of the structure appear reasonable .The structure appears to be unique among OOH compounds , but is the same as that assumed by Af .The bond angles and distances are all within the expected limits and the volume per oxygen is about normal .However , the possible absence of a center of symmetry not only moves the hydrogen atom off Af , but also allows the oxygen atoms to become nonequivalent , with Af at Af and Af at Af ( space group Af ) , where Af represents the oxygens on one side of the Af layers and Af those on the other side .However , any oxygen nonequivalence would shorten either the already extremely short Af interlayer distance of 2.55 A or the non-hydrogen-bonded Af interlayer interactions which are already quite short at 2.58 Aj .Hence it is difficult to conceive of a packing of the atoms in this material in which the oxygen atoms are far from geometrical equivalence .The only effect of lack of a center would then be to release the hydrogen atoms to occupy general , rather than special , positions along the ( 111 ) axis .If the Af bond is linear then there are three reasonable positions for the hydrogen atoms : ( 1 ) The hydrogen atoms are centered and hence all lie on a sheet midway between the oxygen sheets ; ;( 2 ) all hydrogen atoms lie on a sheet , but the sheet is closer to one oxygen sheet than to the other ; ;( 3 ) hydrogen atoms are asymmetrically placed , either randomly or in an ordered way , so that some hydrogen atoms are closer to the upper oxygen atoms while others are closer to the lower oxygen atoms .Position ( 2 ) appears to us to be unlikely in view of the absence of a piezoelectric effect and on general chemical structural grounds .A randomization of `` ups '' and `` downs '' is more likely than ordered `` ups '' and `` downs '' in position ( 3 ) since the hydrogen atoms are well separated and so the position of one could hardly affect the position of another , and also since ordered `` up '' and `` down '' implies a larger unit cell , for which no evidence exists .Therefore , the only unknown structural feature would appear to be whether the hydrogen atoms are located symmetrically ( 1 ) or asymmetrically ( 3 ) .Experimental proceduressamplesDouglass prepared his sample of Af by thermal decomposition of aqueous chromic acid at 300 - 325-degrees-C .Dr. Douglass was kind enough to lend us about 5 grams of his material .This material proved to be unsatisfactory , since we could not obtain reproducible results on various portions of the sample .Subsequently , we learned from Douglass that his sample contained a few percent Af impurity .Since Af is ferromagnetic , we felt that any results obtained from the magnetically contaminated Af would be suspect .Plane suggested another preparation of Af which we used here .500 ml of 1M aqueous Af with 1 Af added are heated in a bomb at 170-degrees-C for 48 hours .A very fine , gray solid ( about 15 g ) is formed , water-washed by centrifugation , and dried at 110-degrees-C ) .Differential thermal analysis showed a very small endothermic reaction at 340-degrees-C and a large endothermic reaction at 470-degrees-C .This latter reaction is in accord with the reported decomposition of Af .Thermogravimetric analysis showed a weight loss of 1.8% centered at 337-degrees-C and another weight loss of 10.8% at 463-degrees-C .The expected weight loss for Af going to Af and Af is 10.6% .Mass spectrometric analysis of gases evolved upon heating to 410-degrees-C indicated nitrogen oxides and water vapor .The small reaction occurring at 337-degrees-C is probably caused by decomposition of occluded nitrates , and perhaps by a small amount of some hydrous material other than Af .All subsequent measurements were made on material which had been heated to 375-degrees-C for one hour .Emission spectra indicated Af calcium and all other impurities much lower .Chromium analysis gave 58.8% Cr as compared with 61.2% theory .However , Af adsorbs water from the atmosphere and this may account for the low chromium analysis and high total weight loss .The x-ray diffraction pattern of the material , taken with CuK**ya radiation , indicated the presence of no extra lines and was in good agreement with the pattern of Douglass .Magnetic analyses by R. G. Meisenheimer of this laboratory indicated no ferromagnetic impurities .Af was found to be paramagnetic with three unpaired electrons per chromium atom and a molecular susceptibility of Af , where Af .For exactly three unpaired electrons the coefficient would be 3.10 .An infrared spectrum , obtained by H. A. Benesi and R. G. Snyder of this laboratory , showed bands in the positions found by Jones .Electron microscopic examination of the Af sample showed it to be composed of nearly isotropic particles about 0.3M in diameter .The particles appeared rough and undoubtedly the single-crystal domains are smaller than this .The x-ray data are consistent with particle sizes of 1000 A or greater .We found no obvious effects due to preferred orientation of the crystallites in this sample nor would we expect to on the basis of the shape found from electron microscopic examination .Nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) measurementsThe magnetic resonance absorption was detected by employing a Varian model Af broad line spectrometer and the associated 12-inch electromagnet system .One measurement at 40 Mc was obtained with the Varian model Af unit .A bridged-T type of bridge was used in the 10 - 16 Mc range .The rf power level was maintained small enough at all times to prevent obvious line shape distortions by saturation effects .A modulation frequency of 40 cps with an amplitude as small as possible , commensurate with reasonably good signal-to-noise quality , was used .Background spectra were obtained in all cases .The spectrometer was adjusted to minimize the amount of dispersion mode mixed in with the absorption signal .A single value of the thermal relaxation time Af at room temperature was measured by the progressive saturation method .The value of Af estimated at 470 gauss was Af microseconds .A single measurement of the spin - spin relaxation time Af was obtained at 10 Mc by pulse methods .This measurement was obtained by W. Blumberg of the University of California , Berkeley , by observing the breadth of the free induction decay signal .The value derived was 16 microseconds .Field shifts were derived from the mean value of the resonance line , defined as the field about which the first moment is zero .Second moments of the spectra were computed by numerical integration .Corrections were applied for modulation broadening , apparatus background , and field shift .Spectra were obtained over the temperature range of 77 - 294-degrees-K .For the low-temperature measurements the sample was cooled by a cold nitrogen gas flow method similar to that of Andrew and Eades .The temperature was maintained to within about Af for the period of time required to make the measurement ( usually about one hour ) .One sample , which had been exposed to the atmosphere after evacuation at 375-degrees-C , showed the presence of adsorbed water ( about 0.3 wt ) ) as evidenced by a weak resonance line which was very narrow at room temperature and which disappeared , due to broadening , at low temperature .The data reported here are either from spectra from which the adsorbed water resonance could easily be eliminated or from spectra of samples evacuated and sealed off at 375-degrees-C which contain no adsorbed water .The measured powder density of the Af used here was about Af , approximately one-third that of the crystal density ( Af ) .Such a density corresponds to a paramagnetic ion density of about Af .Spectra were obtained from a powdered sample having the shape of a right circular cylinder with a height-to-diameter ratio of 4 : :1 .The top of the sample was nearly flat and the bottom hemispherical .Spectra were also obtained from a sample in a spherical container which was made by blowing a bubble on the end of a capillary glass tube .The bubble was filled to the top and special precautions were taken to prevent any sample from remaining in the capillary .Spectra were also obtained from a third sample of Af which had been diluted to three times its original volume with powdered , anhydrous alundum ( Af ) .This sample was contained in a cylindrical container similar to that described above .Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled , That the Act of July 3 , 1952 ( 66 Stat. 328 ) as amended ( 42 U.S.C. 1952-1958 ) , is further amended to read as follows : Section 1 .In view of the increasing shortage of usable surface and ground water in many parts of the Nation and the importance of finding new sources of supply to meet its present and future water needs , it is the policy of the Congress to provide for the development of practicable low-cost means for the large-scale production of water of a quality suitable for municipal , industrial , agricultural , and other beneficial consumptive uses from saline water , and for studies and research related thereto .As used in this Act , the term ' saline water ' includes sea water , brackish water , and other mineralized or chemically charged water , and the term ' United States ' extends to and includes the District of Columbia , the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico , and the territories and possessions of the United States .Sec. 2 .In order to accomplish the purposes of this Act , the Secretary of the Interior shall -- ( A )conduct , encourage , and promote fundamental scientific research and basic studies to develop the best and most economical processes and methods for converting saline water into water suitable for beneficial consumptive purposes ;

;42 U. S. C. 1958 ( ) ) , is hereby amended to read :The authority of the Secretary of the Interior under this joint resolution to construct , operate , and maintain demonstration plants shall terminate upon the expiration of twelve years after the date on which this joint resolution is approved .Upon the expiration of a period deemed adequate for demonstration purposes for each plant , but not to exceed such twelve-year period , the Secretary shall proceed as promptly as practicable to dispose of any plants so constructed by sale to the highest bidder , or as may otherwise be directed by Act of Congress .Upon such sale , there shall be returned to any State or public agency which has contributed financial assistance under Section 3 of this joint resolution a proper share of the net proceeds of the sale .Approved September 22 , 1961 .Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled , That the Secretary of the Interior is hereby authorized and directed to make or cause to be made a study covering -- ( 1 )the causes of injuries and health hazards in Metal and nonmetallic mines ( excluding coal and lignite mines ) ; ;( 2 )the relative effectiveness of voluntary versus mandatory reporting of accident statistics ; ;( 3 )the relative contribution to safety of inspection programs embodying -- ( A )right-of-entry only and ( B )right-of-entry plus enforcement authority ; ;( 4 )the effectiveness of health and safety education and training ; ;( 5 )the magnitude of effort and costs of each of these possible phases of an effective safety program for metal and nonmetallic mines ( excluding coal and lignite mines ) ; ;and ( 6 )the scope and adequacy of State mine-safety laws applicable to such mines and the enforcement of such laws .Sec. 2 .( A )The Secretary of the Interior or any duly authorized representative shall be entitled to admission to , and to require reports from the operator of , any metal or nonmetallic mine which is in a State ( excluding any coal or lignite mine ) , the products of which regularly enter commerce or the operations of which substantially affect commerce , for the purpose of gathering data and information necessary for the study authorized in the first section of this Act .( B )As used in this section -- ( 1 )the term `` State '' includes the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and any possession of the United States ; ;and ( 2 )the term `` commerce '' means commerce between any State and any place outside thereof , or between points within the same State but through any place outside thereof .Sec. 3 .The Secretary of the Interior shall submit a report of his findings , together with recommendations for an effective safety program for metal and nonmetallic mines ( excluding coal and lignite mines ) based upon such findings , to the Congress not more than two years after the date of enactment of this Act .Approved September 26 , 1961 .Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled , That the Secretary of the Interior is hereby authorized and directed to establish and maintain a program of stabilization payments to small domestic producers of lead and zinc ores and concentrates in order to stabilize the mining of lead and zinc by small domestic producers on public , Indian , and other lands as provided in this Act .Sec. 2 .( A )Subject to the limitations of this Act , the Secretary shall make stabilization payments to small domestic producers upon presentation of evidence satisfactory to him of their status as such producers and of the sale by them of newly mined ores , or concentrates produced therefrom , as provided in this Act .Payments shall be made only with respect to the metal content as determined by assay .( B )Such payments shall be made to small domestic producers of lead as long as the market price for common lead at New York , New York , as determined by the Secretary , is below 14-1 cents per pound , and such payments shall be 75 per centum of the difference between 14-1 cents per pound and the average market price for the month in which the sale occurred as determined by the Secretary .( C )Such payments shall be made to small domestic producers of zinc as long as the market price for prime western zinc at East Saint Louis , Illinois , as determined by the Secretary , is below 14-1 cents per pound , and such payments shall be 55 per centum of the difference between 14-1 cents per pound and the average market price for the month in which the sale occurred as determined by the Secretary .( D )The maximum amount of payments which may be made pursuant to this Act on account of sales of newly mined ores or concentrates produced therefrom made during the calendar year 1962 shall not exceed $4,500,000 ; ;the maximum amount of such payments which may be made on account of such sales made during the calendar year 1963 shall not exceed $4,500,000 ; ;the maximum amount of such payments which may be made on account of such sales made during the calendar year 1964 shall not exceed $4,000,000 ; ;and the maximum amount of such payments which may be made on account of such sales made during the calendar year 1965 shall not exceed $3,500,000 .The U.N.'s ' gravest crisis 'Ambassador Stevenson yesterday described the U.N.'s problem of electing a temporary successor to the late Dag Hammarskjold as `` the gravest crisis the institution has faced '' .Of course it is .If the decision goes wrong , it may be -- as Mr. Stevenson fears -- `` the first step on the slippery path downhill '' to a U.N. without operational responsibilities and without effective meaning .The integrity of the office not merely requires that the Secretary General shall be , as the Charter puts it , `` the chief administrative officer of the Organization '' , but that neither he nor his staff shall seek or receive instructions from any government or any other authority `` external to the Organization '' .In other words , the Secretary General is to be a nonpartisan , international servant , not a political , national one .He should be , as Dag Hammarskjold certainly was , a citizen of the world .The Charter does stipulate that `` due regard '' shall be paid to the importance of recruiting the staff on `` as wide a geographical basis as possible '' .The United States and its allies have had no objection to this .What they have objected to is the attempt of the Russians to make use of the tragedy of Dag Hammarskjold's death to turn the entire U.N. staff from the Secretary down into political agents of the respective countries from which they come .The controversy now revolves mainly around the number and geographic origin of the deputies of the Secretary General and , more particularly , around the nature of his relationship with them .Although the United States and the U.S.S.R. have been arguing whether there shall be four , five or six top assistants , the most important element in the situation is not the number of deputies but the manner in which these deputies are to do their work .If any one of them has any power to veto the Secretary General's decisions the nature of the organization will have changed .If they give him advice when he asks it , or if they perform specified duties under his direction , the nature of the U. N. will not of necessity change .The Secretary General must have , subject to the constitutional direction of the Security Council and the General Assembly , the power to act , to propose action and to organize action without being hobbled by advisers and assistants acting on someone else's instructions .This is the root issue for which the United States should stand .We should not become confused or let our public become confused over irrelevant questions of number or even of geography .What we must have , if the United Nations is to survive , is as nonpolitical , nonpartisan an organization at the top as human beings can make it , subject to no single nation's direction and subservient to no single nation's ambition .What the new charter doesThe new City Charter , which should get a Yes vote as Question No. 1 on Nov. 7 , would not make a good Mayor out of a bad one .There is no such magic in man-made laws .But it would greatly strengthen any Mayor's executive powers , remove the excuse in large degree that he is a captive of inaction in the Board of Estimate , increase his budget-making authority both as to expense and capital budgets , and vest in him the right to reorganize city departments in the interest of efficiency and economy .Lawmaking power is removed from the Board of Estimate and made a partnership responsibility of the City Council and the Mayor .Thus there is a clearer division of authority , administrative and legislative .The board is diminished in both respects , while it retains control over zoning , franchises , pier leases , sale , leasing and assignment of property , and other trusteeship functions .The board will be able to increase , decrease , add or eliminate budget items , subject to the Mayor's veto ; ;but the City Council will now share fully this budget-altering power .Overriding of mayoral veto on budget changes will require concurrence by board and Council , and a two-thirds vote .The Controller retains his essential `` fiscal watchdog '' functions ; ;his broad but little used investigative powers are confirmed .He loses now-misplaced tax collection duties , which go to the Finance Department .On net balance , in spite of Controller Gerosa's opposition to the new Charter as an invasion of his office , the Controller will have the opportunity for greater usefulness to good government than he has now .Borough Presidents , while retaining membership in the Board of Estimate , lose their housekeeping functions .Highways go to a new Department of Highways , sewers to the Department of Public Works , such street cleaning as Borough Presidents now do ( in Queens and Richmond ) to the Sanitation Department .Some fiscal changes are important .The expense ( operating ) budget is to be a program budget , and red tape is cut to allow greater autonomy ( with the Mayor approving ) in fund transfers within a department .The capital budget , for construction of permanent improvements , becomes an appropriating document instead of just a calendar of pious promises ; ;but , as a second-look safeguard , each new project must undergo a Board of Estimate public hearing before construction proceeds .A road block to desirable local or borough improvements , heretofore dependent on the pocketbook vote of taxpayers and hence a drag on progress , is removed by making these a charge against the whole city instead of an assessment paid by those immediately affected .This will have a beneficial effect by expediting public business ; ;it will also correct some injustices .Enlargement of the City Council and a new method of selecting members will be discussed tomorrow .Inter-american PressThe Inter-american Press Association , which blankets the Western Hemisphere from northern Canada to Cape Horn , is meeting in New York City this week for the first time in eleven years .The I. A. P. A. is a reflection of the problems and hopes of the hemisphere ; ;and in these days this inevitably means a concentration on the effects of the Cuban revolution .As the press in Cuba was gradually throttled by the Castro regime , more and more Cuban publishers , editors and correspondents were forced into exile .The I. A. P. A. found itself driven from journalism into politics as it did its best to bring about the downfall of the Castro Government and the return of the Cuban press to the freedom it knew before Batista's dictatorship began in 1952 .Freedom of the press was lost in Cuba because of decades of corruption and social imbalances .In such conditions all freedoms are lost .This , in more diplomatic language , is what Adlai Stevenson told the newspaper men of Latin America yesterday on behalf of the United States Government .He felt able to end on a note of hope .He sees evidence of fair winds for the ten-year Alliance for Progress plan with its emphasis on social reforms .No group can contribute more to the success of the program than the editors and publishers of the Inter-American Press Association .Meeting in MoscowThe Twenty-second Soviet Communist Party Congress opens in Moscow today in a situation contrasting sharply with the script prepared many months ago when this meeting was first announced .According to the original program , Premier Khrushchev expected the millions looking toward the Kremlin this morning to be filled with admiration or rage -- depending upon individual or national politics -- because of the `` bold program for building communism in our time '' which the Congress will adopt .But far from being concerned about whether or not Russia will have achieved Utopia by 1980 , the world is watching Moscow today primarily for clues as to whether or not there will be nuclear Armageddon in the immediate future .The evident contradiction between the rosy picture of Russia's progress painted by the Communist party's program and the enormous dangers for all humanity posed by Premier Khrushchev's Berlin policy has already led to speculation abroad that the program may be severely altered .Whether it is or not , the propaganda impact on the free world of the document scheduled to be adopted at this meeting will be far less than had been originally anticipated .And there must be many Soviet citizens who know what is going on and who realize that before they can hope to enjoy the full life promised for 1980 they and their children must first survive .This Congress will see Premier Khrushchev consolidating his power and laying the groundwork for an orderly succession should death or illness remove him from the scene in the next few years .The widespread purge that has taken place the past twelve months or so among Communist leaders in the provinces gives assurance that the party officials who will dominate the Congress , and the Central Committee it will elect , will all have passed the tightest possible Khrushchev screening , both for loyalty to him and for competence and performance on the job .Dr. Conant's call to actionDr. James B. Conant has earned a nationwide reputation as a moderate and unemotional school reformer .His earlier reports considered the American public schools basically sound and not in need of drastic change .Now , a close look at the schools in and around the ten largest cities , including New York , has shattered this optimism .Dr. Conant has come away shocked and angry .His new book , entitled `` Slums And Suburbs '' , calls for fast and drastic action to avert disaster .There is room for disagreement concerning some of Dr. Conant's specific views .His strong opposition to the transfer of Negro children to schools outside their own neighborhood , in the interest of integration , will be attacked by Negro leaders who have fought for , and achieved , this open or permissive enrollment .Dr. Conant may underestimate the psychological importance of even token equality .His suggestion that the prestige colleges be made the training institutions for medical , law and graduate schools will run into strong opposition from these colleges themselves -- even though what he is recommending is already taking shape as a trend .But these are side issues to a powerful central theme .That theme cuts through hypocrisies , complacency and double-talk .It labels the slums , especially the Negro slums , as dead-end streets for hundreds of thousands of youngsters .The villains of the piece are those who deny job opportunities to these youngsters , and Dr. Conant accuses employers and labor unions alike .The facts , he adds , are hidden from public view by squeamish objections to calling bad conditions by their right name and by insistence on token integration rather than on real improvement of the schools , regardless of the color of their students .A call for action `` before it is too late '' has alarming implications when it comes from a man who , in his previous reports on the schools , cautioned so strongly against extreme measures .These warnings must not be treated lightly .Dr. Conant's conscientious , selfless efforts deserve the nation's gratitude .He has served in positions of greater glamour , both at home and abroad ; ;but he may well be doing his greatest service with his straightforward report on the state of the public schools .And now -- more junk mailA fascinating letter has just reached this desk from a correspondent who likes to receive so-called junk mail .He was delighted to learn that the Post Office Department is now going to expand this service to deliver mail from Representatives in Congress to their constituents without the use of stamps , names , addresses or even zone numbers .In accordance with legislation passed at the last session of Congress , each Representative is authorized to deliver to the Post Office in bulk newsletters , speeches and other literature to be dropped in every letter box in his district .This means an added burden to innumerable postmen , who already are complaining of heavy loads and low pay , and it presumably means an increased postal deficit , but , our correspondent writes , think of the additional junk mail each citizen will now be privileged to receive on a regular basis .Our creditors do not forget usLetter writing is a dying art .Occasional letters are sent by individuals to one another and many are written by companies to one another , but these are mostly typewritten .Most mail these days consists of nothing that could truly be called a letter .During the Dorr trial the Democratic press condemned the proceedings and heralded Dorr as a martyr to the principles of the Declaration of Independence .During the Brown trial , however , the state's most powerful Democratic newspaper , the Providence Daily Post , stated that Brown was a murderer , a man of blood , and that he and his associates , with the assistance of Republicans and Abolitionists , had plotted not only the liberation of the slaves but also the overthrow of state and federal governments .The Providence Daily Journal answered the Daily Post by stating that the raid of John Brown was characteristic of Democratic acts of violence and that `` He was acting in direct opposition to the Republican Party , who proclaim as one of their cardinal principles that they do not interfere with slavery in the states '' .The two major newspapers in Providence continued , throughout the crisis , to accuse each other of misrepresenting the facts and attempting to falsify history .While the Daily Post continued to accuse Republicans and the Daily Journal continued to accuse Democrats , the Woonsocket Patriot complained that the Virginia authorities showed indecent and cowardly haste to condemn Brown and his men .Editor Foss stated , `` Of their guilt there can be no doubt but they are entitled to sufficient time to prepare for trial , and a fair trial '' .The Providence Daily Post thought that there were probably good reasons for the haste in which the trial was being conducted and that the only thing gained by a delay would be calmer feelings .The Providence Daily Journal stated that although the guilt of Brown was evident , the South must guarantee him a fair trial to preserve domestic peace .On October 31 , 1859 , John Brown was found guilty of treason against the state of Virginia , inciting slave rebellion , and murder .For these crimes he was sentenced to be hanged in public on Friday , December 2 , 1859 .Upon receiving the news , Northern writers , editors , and clergymen heaped accusations of murder on the Southern states , particularly Virginia .Although Rhode Islanders were preparing for the state elections , they watched John Brown's trial with extreme interest .On Wednesday morning , November 2 , 1859 , the Providence Daily Journal stated that although Brown justly deserved the extreme penalty , no man , however criminal , ought to suffer the penalty without a fair trial .The editor's main criticism of the trial was the haste with which it was conducted .The readers of the Providence Daily Post , however , learned that it was generally conceded that `` Old Brown '' had a fair trial .Concerning the sentence the editor asked , `` What else can Virginia do than to hang the men who have defied her laws , organized treason , and butchered her citizens '' .In the eastern section of the state the newspapers' reaction to Brown's trial and sentence were basically identical .J. Wheaton Smith , editor of the Warren Telegraph stated that `` the ends of justice must be satisfied , a solitary example must be set , in order that all those misnamed philantropists , who , actuated by a blind zeal , dare to instigate riot , treason , and murder , may heed it and shape their future course accordingly '' .The editor of the Newport Advertiser could discover no evidence of extenuating circumstances in the Brown trial which would warrant making an exception to the infliction of capital punishment .In direct contrast to the other Rhode Island editors , Samuel S. Foss of the Woonsocket Patriot outwardly condemned the trial as being completely unfair .Concerning the sentence , Foss wrote , `` If it be possible that mercy shall override vengeance and that John Brown's sentence shall be commuted to imprisonment , it would be well -- well for the country and for Virginia '' .Despite the excitement being caused by the trial and sentence of John Brown , Rhode Islanders turned their attention to the state elections .The state had elected Republican candidates in the past two years .There was no doubt as to the control the Republican party exercised throughout the state .If it failed on occasion to elect its candidates for general state offices by majorities , the failure was due to a lingering remnant of the Know-Nothing party , which called itself the American Republican party .The American Republicans and the Republicans both nominated Lieutenant-Governor Turner for governor .Elisha R. Potter was the Democratic candidate .The results of the election of 1859 found Republican candidates not only winning the offices of governor and lieutenant-governor but also obtaining the two Congressional offices from the eastern and western sections of the state .During the month of November hardly a day passed when there was not some mention of John Brown in the Rhode Island newspapers .On November 7 , 1859 , the Providence Daily Journal reprinted a letter sent to John Brown from `` E. B. '' , a Quaker lady in Newport .In reference to Brown's raid she wrote , `` though we are non-resistants and religiously believe it better to reform by moral and not by carnal weapons , we know thee was anemated by the most generous and philanthropic motives '' .`` E. B. '' compared John Brown to Moses in that they were both acting to deliver millions from oppression .In contrast to `` E. B. '' , most Rhode Islanders hardly thought of John Brown as being another Moses .Most attempts to develop any sympathy for Brown and his actions found an unresponsive audience in Rhode Island .On Wednesday evening , November 23 , 1859 , in Warren , Rev. Mark Trafton of New Bedford , gave a `` Mission of Sympathy '' lecture in which he favorably viewed the Harper's Ferry insurrection .The Warren Telegraph stated that many of Rev. Trafton's remarks were inappropriate and savored strongly of radicalism and fanaticism .In its account of the Trafton lecture , the Providence Daily Post said that the remarks of Rev. Trafton made the people indignant .No sympathy or admiration for Brown could be found in the Providence Daily Post , for the editor claimed that there were a score of men in the state prison who were a thousand times more deserving of sympathy .The Providence Daily Journal , however , stated that Brown's courage , bravery , and heroism `` in a good cause would make a man a martyr ; ;it gives something of dignity even to a bad one '' .The Woonsocket Patriot admitted that John Brown might deserve punishment or imprisonment `` but he should no more be hung than Henry A. Wise or James Buchanan '' .The Newport Mercury exhibited more concern over the possibility of the abolitionists making a martyr of Brown than it did over the development of sympathy for him .In her letter to John Brown , `` E. B. '' , the Quakeress from Newport , had suggested that the American people owed more honor to John Brown for seeking to free the slaves than they did to George Washington .During the latter days of November to the day of Brown's execution , it seems that most Rhode Islanders did not concur in `` E. B.'s '' suggestion .On November 22 , 1859 , the Providence Daily Journal stated that although Brown's `` pluck '' and honest fanaticism must be admired , any honor paid to Brown would only induce other fanatics to imitate his actions .A week later the Daily Journal had discovered the initial plans of some Providence citizens to hold a meeting honoring John Brown on the day of his execution .The editor of the Daily Journal warned , `` that if such a demonstration be made , it will not find support or countenance from any of the men whose names are recognized as having a right to speak for Providence '' .The Providence Daily Post's editor wrote that he could not believe that a meeting honoring Brown was to be held in Providence .He further called upon the people of Providence to rebuke the meeting and avoid disgrace .On December 2 , 1859 , John Brown was hanged at Charles Town , Virginia .Extraordinary precautions were taken so that no stranger be allowed in the city and no citizen within the enclosure surrounding the scaffold .In many Northern towns and cities meetings were held and church bells were tolled .Such was not the case in Rhode Island .The only public demonstration in honor of John Brown was held at Pratt's Hall in Providence , on the day of his execution .Despite the opposition of the city newspapers , the Pratt Hall meeting `` brought together a very respectable audience , composed in part of those who had been distinguished for years for their radical views upon the subject of slavery , of many of our colored citizens , and of those who were attracted to the place by the novelty of such a gathering '' .Seated on the platform were Amos C. Barstow , ex-mayor of Providence and a wealthy Republican stove manufacturer ; ;Thomas Davis , an uncompromising Garrisonian ; ;the Reverend Augustus Woodbury , a Unitarian minister ; ;the Reverend George T. Day , a Free-Will Baptist ; ;Daniel W. Vaughan , and William H. H. Clements .The latter two were appointed secretaries .The first speaker was Amos C. Barstow who had been unanimously chosen president of the meeting .He spoke of his desire to promote the abolition of slavery by peaceable means and he compared John Brown of Harper's Ferry to the John Brown of Rhode Island's colonial period .Barstow concluded that as Rhode Island's John Brown became a canonized hero , if not a saint , so would it be with John Brown of Harper's Ferry .The next speaker was George T. Day .Although admitting Brown's guilt on legal grounds , Day said that , `` Brown is no common criminal ; ;his deed was not below , but above the law '' .Following Day was Woodbury who spoke of his disapproval of Brown's attempt at servile insurrection , his admiration of Brown's character , and his opposition to slavery .Woodbury's remarks were applauded by a portion of the audience several times and once there was hissing .The fourth and last speaker was Thomas Davis .By this time large numbers of the audience had left the hall .Davis commenced his remarks by an allusion to the general feeling of opposition which the meeting had encountered from many of the citizens and all the newspapers of the city .He said that the propriety or impropriety of such a gathering was a question that was to be settled by every man in accordance with the convictions of private judgments .In the remainder of his speech Davis spoke of his admiration for Brown and warned those who took part in the meeting that they `` are liable to the charge that they are supporting traitors and upholding men whom the laws have condemned '' .He recalled that in Rhode Island a party opposed to the state's condemnation of a man ( Thomas W. Dorr ) proclaimed the state's action as a violation of the law of the land and the principles of human liberty .At the close of Davis' speech the following preamble and resolutions were read by the president , and on the question of their adoption passed unanimously :Whereas , John Brown has cheerfully risked his life in endeavoring to deliver those who are denied all rights and is this day doomed to suffer death for his efforts in behalf of those who have no helper : Therefore ,Resolved that , while we most decidedly disapprove the methods he adopted to accomplish his objects , yet in his willingness to die in aid of the great cause of human freedom , we still recognize the qualities of a noble nature and the exercise of a spirit which true men have always admired and which history never fails to honor .Resolved that his wrongs and bereavements in Kansas , occasioned by the violence and brutality of those who were intent on the propagation of slavery in that territory , call for a charitable judgment upon his recent efforts in Virginia to undermine the despotism from which he had suffered , and commend his family to the special sympathy and aid of all who pity suffering and reverence justice .Resolved that the anti-slavery sentiment is becoming ripe for resolute action .Resolved , that we find in this fearful tragedy at Harper's Ferry a reason for more earnest effort to remove the evil of slavery from the whole land as speedily as possible .On the morning following the Pratt Hall meeting the editor of the Providence Daily Journal wrote that although the meeting was milder and less extreme than those held in other areas for similar purposes , it could have been avoided completely .The sentry was not dead .He was , in fact , showing signs of reviving .He had been carrying an Enfield rifle and a holstered navy cap-and-ball pistol .A bayonet hung in a belt scabbard .He was partially uniformed in a cavalry tunic and hat .Mike stripped these from him and donned them .He and Dean tied and gagged the man , using his belt and shirt for the purpose .They dragged him inside the building .Fiske joined them , unsteady on his feet .Julia , seeing the bandage , rushed to him .`` You are hurt '' ! !She breathed .`` I never felt better in my life '' , Fiske blustered .He turned to Susan and kissed her on the cheek .`` Thank you , My dear '' , he said .`` You are very brave '' .Mike silenced them .`` We'll talk later .First , we've got to get out of here '' .`` We'll grab horses '' , Dean said .`` The main bunch is outside , but there are some over there inside the wall '' .Mike debated it , trying to decide whether Fiske was strong enough to ride .But it at least offered him a chance for living .He had none here .And , for the sake of Julia and Susan , it had to be tried .The guerrilla bivouac remained silent .Light showed in the orderly room across the parade ground .Someone evidently was on duty there .No doubt there would be men guarding the horses .About a dozen animals were held inside the stockade , as best Mike could make out in the moonlight .Evidently this was a precaution so that mounts would be available in an emergency .He handed the guard's rifle to Fiske .`` Dean and myself will try to cut out horses to ride '' , he said .`` We'll stampede the rest .You stay with the ladies .All of you be ready to ride hell for leather '' .He added , `` If this doesn't work out , the three of you barricade yourself in the house and talk terms with them '' .He handed the bayonet to Dean and kept the pistol .Susan halted Dean and kissed him .She clung to him , talking to him , and dabbing at her eyes .Mike turned away .He was thinking that the way she had responded to his own kiss hadn't meant what he had believed it had .He felt unutterably weary .Dean turned from Susan and took Julia Fortune in his arms .He kissed her also , and with deep tenderness .She too began to weep .He released her and joined Mike .`` All right '' , he said .Mike only said , `` Later '' .`` Be careful , McLish '' ! !Susan said fiercely .`` The way you were careful '' ? ?He snorted .`` Running around in the moonlight almost naked and slugging a man with a rock '' ? ?He kept going .He wanted no more sentimental scenes with her .He might say or do something foolish .Something all of them would regret .He might tell her how sorry a spectacle she was making of herself , pretending to be blind to the way Julia Fortune had taken Dean's affections from her .And using him , Mike McLish , as a sop to her pride .He handed the bayonet to Dean and kept the pistol .`` Stay well back of me '' , he said .`` I'm going to walk up to the horses , bold as brass , pretending I'm one of the guerrillas .There's bound to be someone on guard , but the hat might fool them long enough for me to get close '' .Holding the pistol concealed , he walked to the rear wall of the stockade .It was pierced by a wagon gate built of two wings .One wing stood open .Mike passed through it and moved toward the dark mass of horses .They were tethered , army style , on stable lines .A voice spoke near-at-hand .`` Who's that '' ? ?Just me '' , Mike said .`` Is that you , Bill '' ? ?He located his man .The guard stood in the shadow of the stockade wall just out of reach of the moonlight .Mike kept walking and got within arm's reach before the man became suspicious and straightened from his lax slouch .Mike struck with the muzzle of the pistol .But the luck that had been running their way left him .The guard instinctively parried the blow with his rifle .He tried to veer the rifle around to fire into Mike's body .Mike , off balance , managed to bat the muzzle away a moment before it exploded .The bullet went wide .Mike swung the pistol in a savage backlash .This time it connected solidly on the man's temple , felling him .The explosion of the rifle had crashed against the walls of the stockade and the deep echoes were still rolling in the hills .The startled horses began rearing on their tethers .Dean came rushing up .`` Are you hit '' ? ?He demanded .`` No , but the fat's in the fire '' ! !Mike said .`` There's no chance now of all of us getting away .You'll have to try it alone '' .The sentry's saddled horse stood picketed nearby , having been kept handy in case of need .Mike took the bayonet from Dean's hand and slashed the picket line .`` Up you go '' ! !He said .`` Ride '' ! !Dean resisted Mike's attempt to push him toward the horse .`` Why not you '' ? ?He protested .`` Dammit '' ! !Mike said frantically .`` You're lighter than me .It's our only chance now .Try to find these Feds .The rest of us can fort up in the house and hang on until you get back .You're the one that's taking the big chance '' .Dean still hesitated , but Mike lifted him almost bodily into the saddle and thrust the reins in his hand .`` No telling how good this horse is '' , Mike panted .`` Favor him and save something in case you hit trouble .Watch out for Apaches when it comes daylight .Take the pistol .You might need it .We'll still have the rifle , and I might be able to round up some more .I'll stampede the rest of these horses so they can't chase you '' .Dean leaned from the saddle and gave him a mighty whack on the back .`` McLish '' , he said as he kicked the horse into motion , `` I'd be a mighty sad man if we never met again '' .Then he was on his way at a gallop .Mike ran down the line , slashing picket ropes with the bayonet .He lifted a screeching war whoop .That touched off a total stampede .He darted inside the stockade and freed the horses there .These poured through the gate and joined the flight .The animals thundered away into the moonlight , heading for the ridges .The guerrillas were swarming from their bivouac at the west end of the enclosure .`` Apaches '' ! !Mike yelled .`` They're stealin' the stock '' ! !He scuttled in shadow along the east wall of the stockade and then followed the south wall until he was at the rear of the two frame buildings .He crouched there .His shout had been taken up and repeated .The guerrillas were running across the parade ground and through the rear gate in the wake of the departing horses .All were carrying guns they had seized up , but they were half-clad or hardly clad at all .Durkin and Calhoun came running from the post .They had pistols in their hands .They bawled questions that were not answered in the uproar .They followed the others toward the east gate .Beyond the stockade rifles began to explode as some of the guerrillas fired at shadows that they imagined were Apaches .Mike made a dash to the rear of the frame buildings .He crawled beneath the two supply wagons which stood between the buildings and peered around a corner .The area was deserted .A man was standing in the open door of the lighted orderly room a few yards to Mike's left , but he , too , suddenly made up his mind and went racing to join the confused activity at the east end of the stockade .Mike crawled to the door and peered in .The orderly room seemed to be deserted .A lantern hung from a peg , giving light .Ducking inside , he found that three rifles were stacked in a corner .A brace of pistols , holstered on belts , hung from a peg , along with ammunition pouches .An ammunition case stood open , containing canisters which contained powder cartridges .Mike seized a blanket from a pallet in a corner , spread it on the floor and used it to form a bag in which he placed his booty .Shouldering the load he peered from the door .His looting of the orderly room had taken only a minute or two and the vicinity was still clear of guerrillas .He looked at the looming hoods of the supply wagons , struck by a new inspiration .He set his bundle down .Snatching the lantern from its peg , he shattered its globe with a blow against a post .He picked up the powder canister and ran out .Bursting paper cartridges , he scattered powder beneath the nearest wagon and dumped the contents of the canister upon it .He shouldered the blanket again , backed off , and tossed the lantern with its open wick beneath the wagon .He turned and raced across the parade ground toward the rock house .Powder flame gushed beneath the wagon .The stockade was brilliantly lighted and the guerrillas sighted him .They realized the truth .Bullets began to snap past him .One struck the muzzle of one of the rifles that projected from the shoulder pack .Its force spun him around , but he recovered and got into stride again .A bullet tore the earth from beneath his foot when he was a stride or two from safety .Another struck him heavily in the thigh and he went down .Guerrillas were racing toward him .Susan and Julia came from the door and dragged him with them .The three of them floundered through the door into the interior and fell in a heap .Susan bounced to her feet and slammed the door .She crouched aside as bullets beat at the portal , chewing into the planks .Some tore entirely through the whipsawed post oak .The iron hinges held , but the planks were in danger of being torn from the crossbars .Mike rolled to Susan , grasped her around the knees , dragging her off her feet .He hovered over her to shield her , for spent bullets were thudding against the rear walls .He peered from a loophole .Guerrillas were only a dozen yards away , charging the house .Mike snatched a pistol from the heap of scattered booty and fired .He dropped a man with the first bullet .At the same moment Wheeler Fiske fired the rifle Mike had given him and another guerrilla was hit .That halted the rush .The guerrillas scattered for cover .The wagons were burning fiercely .The mudwagon had caught fire also .The blaze was spreading to the frame buildings .The guerrillas realized they faced a new problem .`` Gawdamighty '' ! !One screeched .`` There goes our grub an' ammunition '' ! !`` Get a bucket line going '' ! !Calhoun shouted .`` Hurry ! !Hurry '' ! !The guerrillas began a frantic search for pails in which to bring water from the spring .But what few containers they found were inadequate .Many of them , in increasing panic , came running with water in their hats in a ludicrous effort .Both buildings were in flames .The heat drove the guerrillas back .The roof of the command post began to buckle .`` Drag the wagons to the spring '' ! !Lew Durkin yelled .`` Run 'em right into the spring ! !Hustle '' ! !One of the wagons erupted a massive pillar of flame .A sizable supply of powder had been touched off .The wagons and the coach were beyond saving and so were the buildings .The glow of the fire reached through the openings in the windows , giving light enough to examine Mike's wound .The bullet had torn through the flesh just above the knee , inflicting an ugly gash that was forming a pool of blood on the floor .But it had missed the bone and had passed on through .Susan and Julia ripped strips from their clothing and bound the injury .Mike tested the leg and found that he was able to hobble around on it .Anglo-Saxon and Greek epic each provide on two occasions a seemingly authentic account of the narration of verse in the heroic age .Hrothgar's court bard sings of the encounters at Finnsburg ( lines 1068 - 1159 ) , and improvises the tale of Beowulf's exploits in a complimentary comparison of the Geatish visitor with Sigemund ( lines 871 - 892 ) ; ;Alcinous' court bard sings of the discovered adultery of Ares and Aphrodite ( Odyssey 8 266-366 ) , and takes up a tale of Odysseus while the Ithacan wanderer listens on ( Odyssey 8 499-520 ) .Nothing in all this is autobiographical : unlike the poets of Deor and Widsith , the poet of Beowulf is not concerned with his own identity ; ;the poet of The Odyssey , reputed blind , reveals himself not at all in singing of the blind minstrel Demodocus .Since none of these glimpses of poetizing without writing is intended to incorporate a signature into the epic matter , there is prima-facie evidence that Beowulf and the Homeric poems each derive from an oral tradition .That such a tradition lies behind The Iliad and The Odyssey , at least , is hard to deny .Milman Parry rigorously defended the observation that the extant Homeric poems are largely formulaic , and was led to postulate that they could be shown entirely formulaic if the complete corpus of Greek epic survived ; ;he further reasoned that frequent formulas in epic verse indicate oral composition , and assumed the slightly less likely corollary that oral epic is inclined towards the use of formulas .Proceeding from Parry's conclusions and adopting one of his schemata , Francis P. Magoun , Jr. , argues that Beowulf likewise was created from a legacy of oral formulas inherited and extended by bards of successive generations , and the thesis is striking and compelling .Yet a fresh inspection will indicate one crucial amendment : Beowulf and the Homeric poems are not at all formulaic to the same extent .The bondage endurable by an oral poet is to be estimated only by a very skilful oral poet , but it appears safe to assume that no sustained narrative in rhyme could be composed without extreme difficulty , even in a language of many terminal inflections .Assonance seems nearly as severe a curb , although in a celebrated passage William of Malmesbury declares that A Song Of Roland was intoned before the battle commenced at Hastings .The Anglo-Saxon alliterative line and the Homeric hexameter probably imposed less of a restraint ; ;the verse of Beowulf or of The Iliad and The Odyssey was not easy to create but was not impossible for poets who had developed their talents perforce in earning a livelihood .Yet certain aids were valuable and quite credibly necessary for reciting long stretches of verse without a pause .The poet in a written tradition who generally never blots a line may once in a while pause and polish without incurring blame .But the oral poet cannot pause ; ;he must improvise continuously with no apparent effort .Even though the bondage of his verse is not so great as the writing poet can manage , it is still great enough for him often to be seriously impeded unless he has aids to facilitate rapid composition .The Germanic poet had such aids in the kennings , which provided for the difficulties of alliteration ; ;the Homeric poet had epithets , which provided for recurring needs in the hexameter .Either poet could quickly and easily select words or phrases to supply his immediate requirements as he chanted out his lines , because the kennings and the epithets made possible the construction of systems of numerous synonyms for the chief common and proper nouns .Other synonyms could of course serve the same function , and for the sake of ease I shall speak of kennings and epithets in the widest and loosest possible sense , and name , for example , Gar-Dene a kenning for the Danes .Verbal and adverbial elements too participated in each epic diction , but it is for the present sufficient to mark the large nominal and adjectival supply of semantic near-equivalents , and to designate the members of any system of equivalents as basic formulas of the poetic language .Limited to a few thousand lines of heroic verse in Anglo-Saxon as in the other Germanic dialects , we cannot say how frequently the kennings in Beowulf recurred in contemporary epic on the same soil .But we can say that since a writing poet , with leisure before him , would seem unlikely to invent a technique based upon frequent and substantial circumlocution , the kennings like the epithets must reasonably be ascribed to an oral tradition .One of the greatest Homerists of our time , Frederick M. Combellack , argues that when it is assumed The Iliad and The Odyssey are oral poems , the postulated single redactor called Homer cannot be either credited with or denied originality in choice of phrasing .Any example of grand or exquisite diction may have been created by the poet who compiled numerous lays into the two works we possess or may be due to one of his completely unknown fellow-craftsmen .The quest of the historical Homer is likely never to have further success ; ;no individual word in The Iliad or The Odyssey can be credited to any one man ; ;no strikingly effective element of speech in the extant poems can with assurance be said not to have been a commonplace in the vaster epic corpus that may have existed at the beginning of the first millennium before Christ .This observation is of interest not only to students of Homeric poetry but to students of Anglo-Saxon poetry as well .To the extent that a tale is twice told , its final author must be suspect , although plagiarism in an oral tradition is less a misdemeanor than the standard modus dicendi .Combellack argues further , and here he makes his main point , that once The Iliad and The Odyssey are thought formulaic poems composed for an audience accustomed to formulaic poetry , Homeric critics are deprived of an entire domain they previously found arable .With a few important and a few more unimportant exceptions , no expression can be deemed le mot juste for its context , because each was very probably the only expression that long-established practice and ease of rapid recitation would allow .Words or phrases that connoisseurs have admired as handsome or ironic or humorous must therefore lose merit and become regarded as mere inevitable time-servers , sometimes accurate and sometimes not .This observation too may have reference to Anglo-Saxon poetry .To the extent that a language is formulaic , its individual components must be regarded as no more distinguished than other cliches .W. F. Bryan suggests that certain kennings in Beowulf were selected sometimes for appropriateness and sometimes for ironic inappropriateness , but such a view would appear untenable unless it is denied that the language of Beowulf is formulaic .If the master of scops who was most responsible for the poem ever used kennings that were traditional , he was at least partly deprived of free will and not inclined towards shrewd and sophisticated misuse of speech elements .Once many significant phrases are found in theory or in recurrent practice to provide for prosodic necessity , they are not to be defended for their semantic properties in isolated contexts .It is false to be certain of having discovered in the language of Beowulf such effects as intentional irony .Yet , if the argument is turned awry , there may be found a great deal in Bryan's view , after all .A formulaic element need not be held meaningless merely because it was selected with little conscious reflection .Time-servers , though the periphrastic expressions are , they may nevertheless be handsome or ironic or humorous .A long evolution in an oral tradition caused the poetic language of the heroic age to be based upon formulas that show the important qualities of things , and these formulas are therefore potentially rather than always actually accurate .True , we do not know how they were regarded in their day , but we need not believe the epic audience to have been more insensitive to the formulas than the numerous scholars of modern times who have read Germanic or Homeric poetry all their lives and still found much to admire in occasional occurrences of the most familiar phrases .Nouns and adjectives in a written tradition are chosen for the nonce ; ;in an oral tradition they may be chosen for the entire epic corpus , and tend towards idealization rather than distinctive delineation .Reliance is therefore not to be placed upon the archaeological particulars in an oral poem ; ;no-one today would hope to discover the unmistakable ruins of Heorot or the palace of Priam .A ship at dry-dock could be called a foamy-necked floater in Anglo-Saxon or a swift ship in Greek .Even when defenseless of weapons the Danes would be Gar-Dene ( as their king is Hrothgar ) and Priam would be EUMMELIHS .Achilles , like Siegfried in The Nibelungenlied , is potentially the swiftest of men and may accordingly be called swift-footed even when he stands idle .In Coriolanus the agnomen of Marcius is used deliberately and pointedly , but the Homeric epithets and the Anglo-Saxon kennings are used casually and recall to the hearer `` a familiar story or situation or a useful or pleasant quality of the referent '' .The epic language was not entirely the servant of the poet ; ;it was partly his master .The poet's intentions are difficult to discern and , except to biographers , unimportant ; ;the language , however , is a proper object of scrutiny , and the effects of the language are palpable even if sometimes inevitable .Beowulf and the Homeric poems appear oral compositions .Yet they are written ; ;at some stage in their evolution they were transcribed .Albert B. Lord suggests that the Homeric poems were dictated to a scribe by a minstrel who held in his mind the poems fully matured but did not himself possess the knowledge of writing since it would be useless to his guild , and Magoun argues that the Beowulf poet and Cynewulf may have dictated their verse in the same fashion .This explanation is attractive , but is vitiated at least in part by the observation that Cynewulf , though he used kennings in the traditional manner , was a literate man who four times inscribed his name by runes into his works .If Cynewulf was literate , the Beowulf poet may have been also , and so may the final redactor of The Iliad and The Odyssey .In lieu of the amanuensis to the blind or illiterate bard , one may conceive of a man who heard a vast store of oral poetry recited , and became intimately familiar with the established aids to poetizing , and himself wrote his own compositions or his edition of the compositions of the past .Other theories of origin are compatible with the formulaic theory : Beowulf may contain a design for terror , and The Iliad may have a vast hysteron-proteron pattern answering to a ceramic pattern produced during the Geometric Period in pottery .The account of the growth and final transcription of these epics rests partly , however , upon the degree to which they were formulaic .Carl Eduard Schmidt counted 1804 different lines repeated exactly in the two Homeric poems , and by increasing this figure so as to include lines repeated with very slight modifications he counted 2118 different lines used a total of 5612 times .Thus one line in five from The Iliad and The Odyssey is to be found somewhere else in the two poems .The ratio is thoroughly remarkable , because the lines are so long -- half again as long as those of Beowulf .Anglo-Saxon poetry appears to have no comparable amount of repetition ; ;there is no reason to think that the scop used and re-used whole lines and even lengthy passages after the manner of his Homeric colleague .In determining the extent to which any poem is formulaic it is idle , however , to inspect nothing besides lines repeated in their entirety , for a stock of line-fragments would be sufficient to permit the poet to extemporize with deftness if they provided for prosodic needs .The closest scrutiny is owed to the Anglo-Saxon kennings and the Homeric epithets ; ;if any words or phrases are formulaic , they will be .The Iliad has two words for the shield , ASPIS and SAKOS .Maude's long nose unexpectedly wrinkled up .`` Happened to be in the hall ! !Happened to hear you quarrel about her ! !Oh , well , you can't really blame Lolotte .She lost her beau to you '' .But she was talking of Emile when she saw the black line of the open door ; ;Sarah remembered it clearly .Maude went on .`` I've got to get busy .Miss Celie's taken to her bed , with the door locked .She opened it an inch and poked out the keys for me to give you .Here '' -- She thrust a bundle of keys strung on a thick red cord into Sarah's hand .`` Not that there's much use in locking up the smokehouse and the storehouse now .Drink your coffee '' --coffee .`` It's -- cold '' .Maude suddenly looked quite capable of pouring it down her throat .`` I don't want it '' , Sarah said , firmly .`` Oh .Well -- I'll take it down with me as I go '' .Maude swooped up the cup and hiked up her top hoop as if about to take off with a racing start .At the door she turned back , her Roman nose looking very long now and satiric .`` I forgot .Ben and Lucien have gone after them .It's just like that book your Northern friend wrote -- except there aren't any ice floes to cross and no bloodhounds '' .`` I don't know Mrs. Stowe .What can they do if they find them '' ? ?`` They can't do anything .It's silly , childish , running after them like that .I told Ben so .But of course the paterollers won't be of any help , not with everything so upset and that Yankee cavalry outfit they say is running around , God knows where '' .She had swished away , she had been gone for a long time probably when Sarah suddenly realized that she ought to stop her , pour out the coffee , so no one would drink it .But then the so-called coffee was bad enough at best , cold it was all but undrinkable -- especially that cup ! !She was deeply , horribly sure that Lucien had filled it with opium .She had quarreled with Lucien , she had resisted his demands for money -- and if she died , by the provisions of her marriage contract , Lucien would inherit legally not only the immediate sum of gold under the floorboards in the office , but later , when the war was over , her father's entire estate .She felt cold and hot , sticky and chilly at the same time .Now wait a minute , she told herself , think about it ; ;Lucien is not the only person in this house who could have put opium in that coffee .She had lost a bottle of opium -- but that was on the trip from New Orleans .Or someone had taken it during her first day at Honotassa .Yes , she had missed it after her talk with Emile , after dinner , just before Emile was shot .Rilly or Glendora had entered her room while she slept , bringing back her washed clothes .So somebody else could have come in , too -- then or later while she was out of the room .It would have been easy to identify as opium by its odor .It was not very reasonable to believe that Lucien had procured unprocurable opium and come back to Honotassa with a formed plan to murder her .He didn't even know that she was there .And he certainly couldn't have guessed that she would resist his demand for the gold or that she was not the yielding -- yes , and credible fool he had every right to expect .No , he had been surprised , unpleasantly surprised , but surprised .Then somebody else ? ?Don't question , Rev had said , don't invite danger .Her skin crawled : Lolotte had told Maude that she was in the hall and the door was open .Sarah had begun to tell Lucien of Emile , she had begun to question and a little draft had crept across the room from the bedroom door , open barely enough to show a rim of blackness in the hall .So Lolotte -- or anybody -- could have listened , and that somebody could have already been supplied with the missing bottle of opium .That was not reasonable either .The opium had disappeared before Emile's death and whoever shot him could not by any stretch of the imagination have foreseen Sarah's own doubts and suspicions -- and questions .She began to doubt whether there had been in fact a lethal dose of opium in the cup .So suppose somebody only wished to frighten her , so she would leave Honotassa ! !That made a certain amount of logic .Added to the argument was the fact that while she might have tasted the coffee if it had been still hot , she might even have drunk some of it , she wouldn't have taken enough to kill her , for she would have been warned by its taste .No .It was merely an attempt to frighten her .She wouldn't go back to New York as Maude suggested ; ;she wouldn't run like a scared cat .But -- well , she'd be very careful .She dressed and the accustomed routine restored to her a sense of normal everyday life .But before she left her room she dug into her big moire bag , took out the envelope holding her marriage contract and the wax seal had been broken .So somebody else knew what would happen to her father's money if she died .Rev had known all along .Rev didn't need to break the wax seal , read the contract and find out .He could conceivably have wished to make sure ; ;Rev loved Honotassa , it was like a part of his breath and body ; ;Rev had stressed the need for money .Rev would never have tried to give her poison ! !She thrust the envelope back in the bag ; ;there was no point in locking it up in the armoire now , it was like locking the barn after the horse was stolen .And in all likelihood , by now , there was more than one person in the house who knew the terms of her marriage contract .There was no point either in telling herself again what a fool she'd been .She went downstairs and received another curious shock , for when Glendora flapped into the dining room in her homemade moccasins , Sarah asked her when she had brought coffee to her room and Glendora said she hadn't .`` Too much work this morning , Miss Sarah -- everybody gone like that '' --Sarah swallowed past another kind of constriction in her throat .`` Well , then who brought it '' ? ?`` Miss Maude .She come to the kitchen and say she take it up to you '' .Glendora put down a dish of lukewarm rice .`` Not much breakfast this morning .I don't know what we're going to do , Miss Sarah '' .`` We've got to eat '' , Sarah said , curtly , because a chill crawled over her again .Maude ? ?Glendora flapped away .The rice wasn't dosed with opium , indeed it had no taste at all , not a grain of salt .She ate what she could and went out along the covered passageway , with the rain dripping from the vines .In the kitchen Glendora was despairingly picking chickens .`` Get a basket '' , Sarah told her .`` We'll go to the storehouse '' .Glendora dropped a chicken and a flurry of feathers , and went with her through the drizzle , to the storehouse .Sarah found the right key and unlocked the door .It was a long , low room , like a root cellar , for it was banked up with soil , and vines had run rampant over that , too .It was dark but dry and cool .She doled out what Glendora vaguely guessed were the right amounts of dried peas , eggs , cornmeal , a little salt .The shelves looked emptier than when Miss Celie had shown her the storeroom , and since the men from the Commissary had called ; ;there were certainly now fewer mouths to feed but there was less to feed them with .She took Glendora to the smokehouse , unlocked it and saw with satisfaction there was still a quantity of hams and sides of bacon , hanging from the smoke-stained rafters .They wouldn't go hungry , not yet .And the fields were green and growing .`` Can't you possibly imagine what life is going to be like , here '' ? ?Maude had said .Maude .She sent Glendora back to the house , her basket and her apron laden .She stood for a moment , rain dripping from the trees over her head , thinking of Maude .Maude had the opportunity to take the bottle of opium from Sarah's room .Maude had the cool ruthlessness to do whatever she made up her mind to do .She couldn't see how her death could affect Maude .She couldn't see any reason why Maude would attempt to frighten her .Besides , there was something hysterical and silly , something almost childish about an attempt to frighten her .Maude was neither hysterical nor silly and Sarah rather doubted if she had ever been childish .Yet Maude had suggested that Sarah return to New York .Maude could have shot Emile -- if she'd had a reason to kill him .There was no use in standing there in the drizzle , trying to find a link between Emile's murder and opium in a cup of coffee .She started back for the house , saw a light in the office , opened the door and surprised a domestic little scene which was far outside the dark realm of murder or attempted murder .Rev , George and Lolotte were mending shoes .A lighted lamp stood on the table that dusky , drizzling day .They were all three bent over a shabby riding boot ; ;George had a tack hammer .Lolotte held a patch of leather , Rev steadied something , a tiny brad , waiting for George's poised hammer .George said , `` First thing I do when I get to Vicksburg again , is get me a Yankee '' --`` With boots on '' , Lolotte laughed softly .Rev looked up and saw her .Lolotte looked up and stiffened .George didn't look up at all .There was no way to know , no way to guess whether any one of them was surprised at Sarah's appearance , believing her to be drugged and senseless -- and just possibly dead .Rev said , `` Come in , Sarah .Reckon you know the news '' .And what news , Sarah thought as satirically as Maude might have said it .Rev's face was suddenly a little fixed and questioning .He turned to George and Lolotte .`` Take your cobbler's shop somewhere else .I want to talk to Sarah '' .Everything in the office , the spreading circle of lamplight , the patch of leather in Lolotte's hands .George poised with the tack hammer , the homely , everyday atmosphere , all denied an attempt at murder .A rush of panic caught Sarah .`` No .Not now .I mean I've got to -- to see to the kitchen .Glendora '' --Her words jumbled together and she all but ran from the office and from the question in Rev's face .Now why did I do that ? ?She thought as warm , drizzling rain touched her face .She was no schoolgirl , refusing to bear tales .As she reached the kitchen door the answer presented itself ; ;if she told anyone of the opium it must be Lucien , her husband .It might be , indeed it had already proved to be a marriage without love , but it was marriage .So she couldn't choose Rev as a confidant ; ;it must be Lucien .Always provided that Lucien himself had not dosed her coffee with opium , she thought , as coldly and sharply , again , as Maude might have said it .She paused at the kitchen door , caught her breath , told herself firmly that the opium was only an attempt to frighten her and went into the kitchen , where Glendora was eyeing the chickens dismally and Maude was cleaning lamp chimneys .Glendora gave a gulp .`` Miss Sarah , I can't cut up no chicken .Miss Maude say she won't '' .Again the homely , everyday details of daily living refuted a vicious attempt to frighten her -- or to murder her .The homely everyday details of living and domestic requirements also pressed upon her with their immediate urgency .No matter what had happened or hadn't happened , somebody had to see about dinner .She eyed the chickens with , if she had known it , something of Glendora's dismal look and thought with a certain fury of the time she had spent on Latin verbs .Some recent writings assume that the ignorant young couples are a thing of the remote , Victorian past ; ;that nowadays all honeymooners are thoroughly familiar with the best sex-manuals and know enough from talk with friends and personal experimentation to take all the anxiety and hazards out of the situation .Perhaps -- but extensive discussions with contemporary practitioners , family doctors and gynecologists indicate that this is still an area of enormous ignorance .Joking and talking may be freer and easier , but the important factual information is still lacking for far too many newly-married men and women .Various factors in the setting can still be of great advantage in making the first intercourse a good rather than a bad memory for one or both .Privacy must be highly assured both in time and place .That is , locking the room or stateroom door gives privacy of location , but it is equally important to be sure there is time enough for an utterly unhurried fulfillment .If the wedding party lasted late , and the travel schedule means there are only a few hours before resuming the trip or making an early start , the husband may forestall tensions and uncertainties by confiding to his bride that lying in each other's arms will be bliss enough for these few hours .The consummation should come at the next stopping place when they have a long private time ( day or night ) for that purpose .First intercourse for the bride brings with it the various problems connected with virginity and the hymen .One thing should be clear to both husband and wife -- neither pain nor profuse bleeding has to occur when the hymen is ruptured during the first sex act .Ignorance on this point has caused a great deal of needless anxiety , misunderstanding and suspicion .The hymen is , in essence , a fragile membrane that more or less completely covers the entrance to the vagina in most female human beings who have not had sex relations .( Hymen , in fact , is the Greek word for membrane .)Often it is thin and fragile and gives way readily to the male organ at the first attempt at intercourse .As might be expected , girls in this situation bleed very little and perhaps not at all in the process of losing their virginity .It is also important to realize that many girls are born without a hymen or at most only a tiny trace of one ; ;so that the absence of the hymen is by no means positive proof that a girl has had sex relations .But there is a basis in fact for the exaggerations of the folk-lore beliefs .Some hymens are so strongly developed that they cannot be torn without considerable pain to the girl and marked loss of blood .More rarely , the hymen is so sturdy that it does not yield to penetration .Extreme cases are on record in which the doctor has had to use instruments to cut through the hymen to permit marital relations to be consummated .These cases , for all their rarity , are so dramatic that friends and relations repeat the story until the general population may get an entirely false notion of how often the hymen is a serious problem to newly-weds .In recent times , when sexual matters began to be discussed more scientifically and more openly , the emotional aspects of virginity received considerable attention .Obviously , the bridal pair has many adjustments to make to their new situation .Is it necessary to add to the other tensions the hazard of making the loving husband the one who brought pain to his bride ? ?Gynecologists and marriage manuals began to advise that the bride should consult a physician before marriage .If he foresaw any problem because of the quality of the hymen , it was recommended that simple procedures be undertaken at once to incise the hymen or , preferably , to dilate it .As a natural outgrowth of this approach it was often suggested that the doctor should complete the preparation for painless intercourse by dilating the vagina .This recommendation was based on the fact that the hymen was not the only barrier to smooth consummation of the sex act .The vagina is an organ capable of remarkable contraction and dilation .This is obvious when it is remembered that , during childbirth , the vagina must dilate enough to permit the passage of the baby .The intricate system of muscles that manage the contraction and dilatation of the vagina are partly under voluntary control .But an instinctive reflex may work against the conscious intention of the woman .That is , when first penetration takes place , the pressure and pain signals may involuntarily cause all the vaginal muscles to contract in an effort to bar the intrusion and prevent further pain .The advantages of dilatation by the physician are both physical and psychological .Since it is a purely professional situation , none of the pain is associated with love-making or the beloved .By using instruments of gradually increasing size , the vagina is gently , and with minimum pain at each stage , taught to yield to an object of the appropriate shape .In this process the vaginal muscles come under better conscious control by the girl .She learns how to relax them to accept -- instead of contracting them to repel -- the entering object .Apart from the standard problem of controlling the vaginal muscles , other serious barriers may exist that need special gynecological treatment .It is far better to have such conditions treated in advance than to have them show up on the honeymoon where they can create a really serious situation .When no medical problems exist , the newly married couple generally prefer to cope with the adjustments of their new relationship by themselves .Special information and guidance about the possible difficulties are still of great value .Folk-lore , superstition and remembered passages from erotic literature can create physical and emotional problems if blindly taken as scientific facts and useful hints .The importance of loving tenderness is obvious .The long , unhurried approach and the deliberate prolongation of fore-play work on several levels .Under the excitement of caresses and sexual stimulation the vagina relaxes and dilates and the local moisture greatly increases , providing an excellent lubricant to help achieve an easier penetration .Extensive observations by physicians during vaginal examinations have established the fact that a single finger inserted along the anterior wall ( the top line of the vagina as the woman lies on her back ) may cause a great deal of distress in a virgin .But during the same examination , two fingers may be inserted along the posterior wall ( the bottom of the vagina in the same position ) without any pain ; ;and in fact without any difficulty if the pressure is kept downward at all times .These regional differences of sensitivity to pain may be of crucial significance during the earliest intercourse .The husband and wife should start with this anatomical information clearly in mind .They may then adjust their positions and movements to avoid too much pressure on the urethra and the anterior wall of the vagina ; ;at least until repeated intercourse has dilated it and pain is no longer a possible threat against the full pleasure of love-making .In fact , the technical procedure in medical examinations may be wisely adapted to his romantic purposes by the husband during the honeymoon .Locker-room talk often stresses the idea that a man is doing the girl a favor if he is forceful and ruthless during the first penetration .The false reasoning is that a gradual advance prolongs the pain while a swift powerful act gets it over with and leaves the girl pleased with his virility and grateful for his decisiveness in settling the problem once and for all .Such talk is seriously in error .Ruthlessness at this time can be a very severe shock to the bride , both physically and psychologically .The insistent , forceful penetration may tear and inflame the vaginal walls as well as do excessive damage to the hymen .The pain and distress associated with the performance may easily give the wife a deep-seated dread of marital relations and cause her , unconsciously , to make the sex act unpleasant and difficult for both by exercising her vaginal muscles to complicate his penetration instead of relaxing them to facilitate it .Serious attention must also be given to the husband's problems in the honeymoon situation .The necessity for keeping alert to his bride's hazards can act as an interference with the man's spontaneous desire .The emotional stimulation may be so great that he may experience a premature climax .This is a very common experience and should in no way discourage or dishearten either husband or wife .Or the frequent need to check and discipline himself to the wisest pace of the consummation can put him off stride and make it impossible for him to be continuously ready for penetration over a long period .The signals to proceed may therefore come when he is momentarily not able to take advantage of them .The best course is to recover his physical excitement by a change of pace that makes him ardent again .This may require imagination and reminding himself that now he can be demanding and self-centered .He can take security from the fact that the progress he has made by his gentle approach will not be lost .Now while he uses talk , caresses or requires caresses from her , his bride will sympathetically understand the situation and eagerly help him restore his physical situation so they can have the consummation they both so eagerly desire .A final word .The accumulated information on this point shows that first intercourse , even when it is achieved with minimum pain or difficulty , is seldom an overwhelming sexual experience to a woman .Too many new things are happening for it to be a complete erotic fulfillment .Only under rare circumstances would a bride experience an orgasm during her first intercourse .Both man and wife should be aware of the fact that a lack of climax , and even the absence of the anticipated keen pleasure are not a sign that the wife may be cold or frigid .If the early approaches are wise , understanding and patient , the satisfactions of marital fulfillment will probably be discovered before the marriage is much older .Writing in a large volume on the nude in painting and sculptures , titled The Nude : A Study In Ideal Form , Kenneth Clark declares : `` The human body , as a nucleus , is rich in associations .It is ourselves and arouses memories of all the things we wish to do with ourselves '' .Perhaps this is a clue to the amazing variety and power of reactions , attitudes , and emotions precipitated by the nude form .The wide divergence of reactions is clearly illustrated in the Kinsey studies in human sexuality .Differences were related to social , economic , and educational backgrounds .Whereas persons of eighth grade education or less were more apt to avoid or be shocked by nudity , those educated beyond the eighth grade increasingly welcomed and approved nudity in sexual relations .Such understanding helps to explain why one matron celebrating thirty-five years of married life could declare with some pride that her husband had `` never seen her entirely naked '' , while another woman , boasting an equal number of years of married life , is proud of having `` shared the nudist way of life -- the really free , natural nude life -- for most of that period '' .Attempts at censorship always involve and reveal such complex and multiple individual reactions .The indignant crusader sees the nude or semi-nude human form as `` lewd and pornographic , a threat and danger '' to all the young , or good , or religious , or moral persons .The equally ardent proponent of freedom from any kind of censorship may find the nude human form the `` natural , honest , free expression of man's spirit and the epitome of beauty and inspiration '' .One is always a little surprised to bump into such individual distinctions when it is unexpected .I still recall the mild shock I experienced in reading material of an enthusiastic advocate of the `` clean , healthful , free way of natural life in nudism '' , who seemed to brave much misunderstanding and persecution in fine spirit .Los Angeles in 1957 finally bowed to the skyscraper .) And without high density in the core , rapid-transit systems cannot be maintained economically , let alone built from scratch at today's prices .However , the building of freeways and garages cannot continue forever .The new interchange among the four Los Angeles freeways , including the grade-constructed accesses , occupies by itself no less than eighty acres of downtown land , one-eighth of a square mile , an area about the size of Rockefeller Center in New York .It is hard to believe that this mass of intertwined concrete constitutes what the law calls `` the highest and best use '' of centrally located urban land .As it affects the city's fiscal situation , such an interchange is ruinous ; ;it removes forever from the tax rolls property which should be taxed to pay for the city services .Subways improved land values without taking away land ; ;freeways boost valuation less ( because the garages they require are not prime buildings by a long shot ) , and reduce the acreage that can be taxed .Downtown Los Angeles is already two-thirds freeway , interchange , street , parking lot and garage -- one of those preposterous `` if '' statistics has already come to pass .The freeway with narrowly spaced interchanges concentrates and mitigates the access problem , but it also acts inevitably as an artificial , isolating boundary .City planners do not always use this boundary as effectively as they might .Less ambitious freeway plans may be more successful -- especially when the roadways and interchanges are raised , allowing for cross access at many points and providing parking areas below the ramp .Meanwhile , the automobile and its friend the truck have cost the central city some of its industrial dominance .In ever greater numbers , factories are locating in the suburbs or in `` industrial parks '' removed from the city's political jurisdiction .The appeal of the suburb is particularly strong for heavy industry , which must move bulky objects along a lengthy assembly line and wants enough land area to do the entire job on one floor .To light industry , the economies of being on one floor are much slighter , but efficiency engineers usually believe in them , and manufacturers looking for ways to cut costs cannot be prevented from turning to efficiency engineers .This movement of industry away from the central cities is not so catastrophically new as some prophets seem to believe .It is merely the latest example of the leapfrog growth which formed the pattern of virtually all American cities .The big factories which are relatively near the centers of our cities -- the rubber factories in Akron , Chrysler's Detroit plants , U.S. Steel's Pittsburgh works -- often began on these sites at a time when that was the edge of the city , yet close to transport ( river ) , storage ( piers ) and power ( river ) .The `` leapfrog '' was a phenomenon of the railroad and the steam turbine , and the time when the belts of residence surrounding the old factory area were not yet blighted .The truck and the car gave the manufacturer a new degree of freedom in selecting his plant site .Until internal combustion became cheap , he had to be near a railroad siding and a trolley line or an existing large community of lower-class homes .The railroad siding is still important -- it is usually , though not always , true that long-haul shipment by rail is cheaper than trucking .But anybody who promises a substantial volume of business can get a railroad to run a short spur to his plant these days , and many businesses can live without the railroad .And there are now many millions of workers for whom the factory with the big parking lot , which can be reached by driving across or against the usual pattern of rush hour traffic and grille-route bus lines , is actually more convenient than the walk-to factory .Willow Run , General Electric's enormous installations at Louisville and Syracuse , the Pentagon , Boeing in Seattle , Douglas and Lockheed in Los Angeles , the new automobile assembly plants everywhere -- none of these is substantially served by any sort of conventional mass rapid transit .They are all suburban plants , relying on the roads to keep them supplied with workers .And wherever the new thruways go up their banks are lined by neat glass and metal and colored brick light industry .The drive along Massachusetts' Route 128 , the by-pass which makes an arc about twenty miles from downtown Boston , may be a vision of the future .The future could be worse .The plants along Route 128 are mostly well designed and nicely set against the New England rocks and trees .They can even be rather grand , like Edward Land's monument to the astonishing success of Polaroid .But they deny the values of the city -- the crowded , competitive , tolerant city , the `` melting pot '' which gave off so many of the most admirable American qualities .They are segregated businesses , combining again on one site the factory and the office , drawing their work force from segregated communities .It is interesting to note how many of the plants on Massachusetts' Route 128 draw most of their income either from the government in non-competitive cost-plus arrangements , or from the exploitation of patents which grant at least a partial monopoly .While the factories were always the center of the labor market , they were often on the city's periphery .In spreading the factories even farther , the automobile may not have changed to any great extent the growth pattern of the cities .Even the loss of hotel business to the outskirt's motel has been relatively painless ; ;the hotel-motel demarcation is becoming harder to find every year .What hurts most is the damage the automobile has done to central-city retailing , especially in those cities where public transit is feeble .Some retailing , of course , always spreads with the population -- grocery stores , drugstores , local haberdasheries and dress shops , candy stores and the like .But whenever a major purchase was contemplated forty years ago -- a new bedroom set or a winter coat , an Easter bonnet , a bicycle for Junior -- the family set off for the downtown department store , where the selection would be greatest .Department stores congregated in the `` one hundred per cent location '' , where all the transit lines converged .These stores are still there , but the volume of the `` downtown store '' has been on a relative decline , while in many cities the suburban `` branch '' sells more and more dry goods .If the retailer and hotelman's downtown unit sales have been decreasing , however , his dollar volume continues to rise , and it is dollars which you put in the bank .In most discussions of this phenomenon , the figures are substantially inflated .No suburban shopping-center branch -- not even Hudson's vast Northland outside Detroit -- does anything like the unit volume of business or carries anything like the variety of merchandise to be found in the home store .Telephone orders distort the picture : the suburbanite naturally calls a local rather than a central-city number if both are listed in an advertisement , especially if the local call eliminates city sales tax .The suburban branch is thereby credited with a sale which would have been made even if its glass doors had never opened .Accounting procedures which continue to charge a disproportionate overhead and warehouse expense to the main store make the branches seem more profitable than they are .In many cases that statement -- `` We break even on our downtown operation and make money on our branches '' -- would be turned around if the cost analysis were recalculated on terms less prejudicial to the old store .Fear of the competition -- always a great motivating force in the American economy -- makes retailers who do not have suburban operations exaggerate both the volume and the profitability of their rival's shiny new branches .The fact seems to be that very many large branch stores are uneconomical , that the choice of location in the suburbs is as important as it was downtown , and that even highly suburbanized cities will support only so many big branches .Moreover , the cost of operations is always high in any new store , as the conservative bankers who act as controllers for retail giants are beginning to discover .When all has been said , however , the big branch store remains a major break with history in the development of American retailing .Just as the suburban factory may be more convenient than the downtown plant to the worker with a car , the trip to the shopping center may seem far easier than to the downtown department store , though both are the same distance from home .Indeed , there are some cities where the suburban shopping pulls customers who are geographically much nearer to downtown .Raymond Vernon reports that residents of East St. Louis have been driving across the Mississippi , through the heart of downtown St. Louis and out to the western suburbs for major shopping , simply because parking is easier at the big branches than it is in the heart of town .To the extent that the problem is merely parking , an aggressive downtown management , like that of Lazarus Brothers in Columbus , Ohio , can fight back successfully by building a garage on the lot next door .If the distant patron of the suburban branch has been frightened away from downtown by traffic problems , however , the city store can only pressure the politicians to do something about the highways or await the completion of the federal highway program .And if the affection for the suburban branch reflects a desire to shop with `` nice people '' , rather than with the indiscriminate urban mass which supports the downtown department store , the central location may be in serious trouble .Today , according to land economist Homer Hoyt , shopping centers and their associated parking lots cover some 46,000 acres of land , which is almost exactly the total land area in all the nation's Central Business Districts put together .The downtown store continues to offer the great inducement of variety , both within its gates and across the street , where other department stores are immediately convenient for the shopper who wants to see what is available before making up her mind .If anything may be predicted in the quicksilver world of retailing , it seems likely that the suburban branch will come to dominate children's clothing ( taking the kid downtown is too much of a production ) , household gadgetry and the discount business in big-ticket items .Department stores were built on dry goods , especially ladies' fashions , and in this area , in the long run , the suburban branches will be hard put to compete against downtown .If this analysis is correct , the suburban branches will turn out to be what management's cost accountants refuse to acknowledge , marginal operations rather than major factors .Historically in America the appeal of cities has been their color and life , the variety of experience they offered .`` How ya gonna keep 'em down on the farm '' ? ?Was a question that had to be asked long before they saw Paree .Though Americans usually lived in groups segregated by national origin or religious belief , they liked to work and shop in the noise and vitality of downtown .Only a radical change in the nature of the population in the central city would be likely to destroy this preference -- and we must now turn our attention to the question of whether such a change , gloomily foreseen by so many urban diagnosticians , is actually upon us .4 .Suburbs and NegroesIn their book , American Skyline , Christopher Tunnard and Henry Hope Reed argue that Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal was what made the modern suburb a possibility -- a fine ironical argument , when you consider how suburbanites tend to vote .The first superhighways -- New York's Henry Hudson and Chicago's Lake Shore , San Francisco's Bay Bridge and its approaches , a good slice of the Pennsylvania Turnpike -- were built as part of the federal works program which was going to cure the depression .At the same time , Roosevelt's Federal Housing Administration , coupled with Henry Morgenthau's cheap-money policy , permitted ordinary lower-middle-class families to build their own homes .Bankers who had been reluctant to lend without better security than the house itself got that security from the U. S. government ; ;householders who had been unable to pick up the burden of short-term high-interest mortgages found they could borrow for twenty-five years at 4 per cent , under government aegis .`` So it wasn't the earthquake that made him return to his village '' ! !`` No .Now dammit , I don't want to go into any more explanations .Here comes Jason .Keep this to yourself '' .Reverend Jason , looking worried , hurried toward us .`` Anything wrong , cap'n ? ?The men seem to think so '' .`` Dirion found a large war party south of us .They'll probably attack at dawn '' , Montero said .He brushed past the clergyman and walked into the center of the camp .Using his hands as a trumpet he shouted , `` Fort up ! !Fort up ! !There's a large war party on their way '' ! !For a second , engages , cooks , voyageurs appeared struck dumb .Then Little Billy began shouting orders to round up the ponies and fill the water buckets and for the cooks to hurry up with the meal .They all flew into action .`` That was a terrible thing to do '' , I said to Oso .The Aricaras treated us like friends .And here all the time you knew the Sioux would be using our rifles on them ! !God , what a world you people live in '' .Oso gave me an unruffled look .`` Old Knife's got the largest war party ever seen on the river '' , he said calmly .`` What would you have done in Montero's moccasins ? ?Let Old Knife come up and kill you and your people , or would you steer him on someone else '' ? ?He shook his head .`` Mr. Manuel did that in the war .That's why the British never got the tribes to fight for the King .Mr. Manuel whispered in the ears of the Sioux that the Cheyennes were comin' to raid 'em for their horses .Then he went on to the Cheyennes and told them that the Sioux was goin' to move up .He did that with all the Nations .Hell , they were fightin' each other so hard they had no time for anyone else .The War Department wrote Mr. Manuel a letter and said he was a hero .I saw that letter .He carried it in a little wallet made of fish skin '' .`` But that was war '' , I said .`` There's no war on now '' .`` You're wrong , Matt .In this country there's a war on every time the grass turns green .First it was the Nations against themselves , then it was them against the whites .And it's goin' to go on like this year after year until the white people take over this land '' .I remember being told it would happen so fast people would think it took place overnight .`` That's why this company's important .Once we get over the mountains others will come along .That's why the Trust don't want us to make it .That bastard Chambers ! !-- Old Knife's not the only chief he'll get to do his dirty work ! !Before we get through he'll have the Blackfeet hankerin' for our hair and our goods .Well , talkin' ain't goin' to help -- let's fort up '' ! !As I dug in behind one of the bales we were using as protection , I grudgingly found myself agreeing with Oso's logic , especially when I imagined what would have happened to Missy if Old Knife's large party of screeching warriors had overrun our company .For , unlike the Sioux and the Crows , the Aricaras are not great horsemen , nor are they aggressive like the savage Blackfeet .More of an agricultural nation , they have relied on their warriors only for defense and for survival in the endless wars of the plains .Still , I was disgusted with myself for agreeing with Montero's methods .Surprisingly , he had told the others what he had done .In the brief moment I had to talk to them before I took my post on the ring of defenses , I indicated I was sickened by the methods men employed to live and trade on the river .`` I think Montero did right '' , Amy said firmly .`` Let the savages kill each other .What do we care '' ? ?Reverend Jason was understandably bitter .`` It was a terrible thing to do .Those little children .''But Oso replied calmly , `` Trouble ain't easy to dodge out in this country , rev'rend '' .28 .AttackGray Eyes attacked our camp just as the first pink threads stitched together the hills and the sky .Our camp was in the center of a wide valley .Montero had set up a strong position , using every bale and box we had in addition to barricades of logs and brush .He had ordered the ponies brought inside the fortified circle and had assigned Pierre and a band of picked engages the job of trying to keep them steady under fire .The pony herd was the one flaw in our defense ; ;the Rees undoubtedly would try to cut down as many of the animals as possible .Wildly bucking horses would make the position difficult to defend against charging warriors .The cooks had prepared one of the best meals we'd had in a long time , and on Montero's orders had baked enough bread to last the day .Buckets were filled , the herd fed and watered .The worst part had been the waiting ; ;although we didn't expect the attack before dawn , the long cloudy night , filled with the sounds of the industrious insects , seemed endless .Coyotes and hunting wolves sounded like signaling Indian scouts , the whinny of a restless pony made one's skin crawl .Oso slept unconcernedly , his rifle cradled in his arms ; ;I didn't catch a wink .Every time I closed my eyes , I saw Gray Eyes rushing at me with a knife .It was a relief when they finally came .They poured through the opening in the valley , then spread out in a long line to come at us , brandishing their lances and filling the morning with their spine-chilling scalp cry .`` Oso '' , Montero called `` I'll get Gray Eyes '' .`` That'll be a pleasure to see '' , the big black murmured as he stared down the barrel of his rifle .`` Hold your fire '' , Montero was shouting .`` Wait until my shot .I'll shoot the first man who doesn't '' .I could see them in my sights .They were about a mile off ; ;under me the ground quivered slightly .At first they were only feathers and dark indistinguishable faces and bodies , hunched over their horses' heads .Gradually they emerged as men .Gray Eyes was in the lead .His face was split by a vermilion streak , his eyes were pools of white ; ;jagged red and black medicine symbols covered his chest .He was naked except for a clout .Next to him was a young boy I was sure had sat near me at one of the trading sessions .His mouth was open , his neck corded with the strain of his screams .I found his chest in my sights .It had a red circle .The circle came nearer and nearer .My God , how long is he going to wait , I thought .Montero's rifle cracked .At first I thought he had missed .Gray Eyes remained erect .The feathered lance was still above his head .As he started to slump over , another warrior swung him onto his horse .I squeezed the trigger .At the last second I dropped my sights from the bare chest and bright red circle to the chest of his pony .I saw the pony fall like a stone and the young warrior flew over its head , bouncing like a rubber ball .He started to run but Oso's shot caught him on the wing .He jerked once in the grass and lay still .`` If you're goin' to kill 'em -- ! !Kill 'em '' ! !Oso growled .What else he said was lost in the rattle of gunfire on all sides .The Aricaras broke under the devastating fire , wheeled and retreated .`` Lead up ! !Lead up ! !They'll be back '' ! !Montero was shouting .Far up the valley I could see the Rees circling and reorganizing .Out in front of our walls the grass was covered with dead and dying men , war shields , lances , blankets and wounded and dead horses .The morning air was filled with the sweetish odor of new-spilled blood , the acrid stench of frightened horses , and the bitterness of burned powder .A horse screamed as it twisted from side to side in a frenzy .A rifle cracked ; ;the square head fell over .One of the warriors suddenly leaped to his feet and began running across the valley to the trees that lined the small creek .His legs pumped furiously , his long black hair streamed out behind him .There was a ragged volley .He was dead before he hit the ground .`` For Christ's sake , don't waste your powder on one of 'em '' ! !Montero shouted furiously .`` Wait for the charge ! !The charge , I tell you '' ! !The sharp cries at the end of the valley were faint .They grew louder as the Indians charged again .I could see their faces glistening with sweat and bear grease , their mouths open , shouting their spine-chilling cries .`` Gray Eyes is back , , Montero said .The war captain had been badly wounded and was fighting to hold his seat .I could see the blood running down his chest .He was riding between two warriors , who held him erect when he started to slump .I forgot to aim .In my sights I watched him looming bigger and bigger .Montero's shot had caught him high in the chest ; ;there was no doubt he was dying .Again we waited for Montero .This time he delayed so long that some of the engages shouted frantically , but they held their fire .The horses were only several lengths away when he fired .The bullet flung Gray Eyes from his horse .Our rolling volley swept most of the other riders from their mounts .But a few reached our wall .I heard the whir of an ax and a Canadian's face burst apart in a bloody spray .I saw Little Billy rise and fire almost point blank and an Indian's face became shattered flesh and bone .A second leaped from his horse to the top of the bale , firing four arrows in such rapid succession it didn't seem possible they were in flight .Men screamed .Oso reached up , jerked the buck from the bale and snapped his neck .Other Indians were running at the ponies , shrilling and waving blankets .Reverend Jason got one , the Canadians the others .I saw the clergyman kneel for a moment by the twitching body of the man he had shot , then run back to his position .The ponies were almost uncontrollable .The pall of dust they raised made it difficult to see when the Aricaras charged again .This time more of them hurdled the barrier .A small Indian dived at Montero , who caught him with a swift upward stroke of his rifle butt .It sounded like a man kicking a melon .Above me a dark rider was whipping his pony with a quirt in an attempt to hurdle the bales .Although my shot killed his horse , he rolled off the bale on top of me .I could smell woodsmoke , grease , and oil .His eyes were dark , fluid , fearful , and he gave a sigh as my knife went in .Coming over the wall he had seemed like a hideous devil .Now under me I could see him for what he really was , a boy dressed up in streaks of paint .The Aricaras made one last desperate charge .It was pitiful to see the thin ranks of warriors , old and young , wheeling and twisting their ponies frantically from side to side only to be tumbled bleeding from their saddles by the relentless slam , slam of the cruelly efficient Hawkinses .Others , badly wounded , gripped hands in manes , knees in bellies , held on as long as possible and then , weak from ghastly wounds , slipped sideways , slowly , almost thoughtfully , to be broken under the slashing hoofs .Some gracefully soared from the backs of their wounded , screaming mounts to make one last defiant charge before the lead split their hearts or tore their guts .None of them reached our walls again .The few survivors grudgingly turned away .In the distance we could hear the drums and the wail of the death song .Yet a crowd came out to see some fresh kids from the city try to match the boys from the neighboring farms ; ;and buggies and wagons and chugging Fords kept gathering all morning , until the edges of the field were packed thick and small boys kept scampering out on the playing field to make fun of the visitors -- whose pitcher was a formidable looking young man with the only baseball cap .This was a bitterly fought game , carrying almost as much grudge as a fist fight , with no friendliness exhibited between the teams except the formal politeness that accompanied the setting forth of ground rules and agreements on balls that went into the crowd .Every pitch in the game brought forth a howl from the enraptured audience and every fly ball the visitors dropped ( and because their right fielder was still a little fuzzy from drink , they dropped many ) called forth yelps of derision .At one point in the game when the skinny old man in suspenders who was acting as umpire got in the way of a thrown ball and took it painfully in the kidneys , he lay there unattended while players and spectators wrangled over whether the ball was `` dead '' or the base runners were free to score .This was typical of such games , which were earnestly played to win and practically never wound up in an expression of good fellowship .When the visitors , after losing this game , rode along the village streets toward home , the youngsters who could keep abreast of them for a moment or two screamed triumphantly , `` You bunch of hay-shakers ! !G'ahn back home ! !You hay-shakers '' ! !Baseball was surely the national game in those days , even though professional baseball may have been merely a business .Radio broadcasts had not begun and most devotees of baseball attended the games near home , in the town park or a pasture , with perhaps two or three trips to the city each season to see the Cubs or the Pirates or the Indians or the Red Sox .Young men in school could look forward to playing ball for money in a dozen different places , even if they failed to make the major leagues .Nearly any lad with a modicum of skill might find a payday awaiting him in the Three I League , or the Pony League , or the Coastal Plains League , or the fast Eastern League , if not indeed in one of the hundreds of city leagues that abounded everywhere .Even a city of thirty thousand might have six baseball teams , sponsored by grocers and hardware merchants or department stores , that played two or three times a week throughout the summer , usually in the cool of the evening , before an earnest and partisan audience who did not begrudge a quarter each , or even more , to be dropped into a hat when the game was half over .Babe Ruth , of course , was everyone's hero , and everyone knew him , even though relatively few ever saw him play ball .His face was always in the newspapers , sometimes in cartoons that seemed nearly as large as life .As the twenties grew older , and as radio broadcasts of baseball games began to involve more and more people daily in the doings of the professionals , the great hitters ( always led by Babe Ruth ) overshadowed the game so that pitchers were nearly of no account .Boys no longer bothered learning to bunt and even school kids scorned to `` choke up '' on a bat as Willie Keeler and the famous hitters of another day had done .Other hitters bloomed with more or less vigor in the news and a few even dared to dream of matching Ruth , who was still called Jidge by all his friends , or Leo or Two-Head by those who dared to taunt him ( Leo was the name of the ball player he liked the least ) and who called most of the world `` Kid '' .Lou Gehrig was given the nickname Buster , and he ran Ruth a close race in home runs .But the nickname never stuck and Gehrig was no match for Ruth in `` color '' -- which is sometimes a polite word for delinquent behavior on and off the field .Ruth was a delinquent boy still , but he was in every way a great ball player who was out to win the game and occasionally risked a cracked bone to do it .A few professional baseball players cultivated eccentricities , with the encouragement of the press , so that they might see their names in big black print , along with Daddy Browning's , Al Capone's , Earl Sande's , and the Prince of Wales' .One who , for a time , succeeded best and was still the sorriest of all was Charles Arthur Shires , who called himself , in the newspapers , Art the Great , or The Great Shires .It was his brag that he could beat everybody at anything , but especially at fighting , and he once took on the manager of his club and worked him over thoroughly with his fists .He was given to public carousing and to acting the clown on the diamond ; ;and a policeman asserted he had found a pair of brass knuckles in Art's pocket once when he had occasion to collar the Great First Baseman for some forgotten reason .( This made a sportswriter named Pegler wonder in print if Art had worn this armament when he defeated his manager .) The sorry fact about this young man , who was barely of age when he broke into major-league baseball , was that he really was a better ball player than he was given credit for being -- never so good as he claimed , and always an irritant to his associates , but a good steady performer when he could fight down the temptation to orate on his skills or cut up in public .In his minor way Charles Arthur Shires was perhaps more typical of his era than Ruth was , for he was but one of many young men who laid waste their talents in these Scott Fitzgerald days for the sake of earning space in the newspapers .There were others who climbed flagpoles and refused to come down ; ;or who ingested strange objects , like live fish ; ;or who undertook to set records for remaining erect on a dance floor , with or without a partner ; ;or who essayed to down full bottles of illicit gin without pausing for breath .One young man , exhilarated to the point of insanity by liquor and the excitement of the moment , performed a perfect swan dive out of the stands at the Yale Bowl during the Yale-Army football game , landed squarely on his head on the concrete ramp below , and died at once .But the twenties were not all insanity and a striving after recognition .The business of baseball began to prosper along with other entertainments , and performers -- thanks partly to George Herman Ruth's spectacular efforts each season to run his salary higher and higher -- prospered too .While fifty years before , Albert Goodwill Spalding , secretary of the Chicago Ball Club of the National League , could write earnestly to the manager of the Buffalo club and request a guarantee of one hundred dollars for a baseball game in August , in this Golden Era a game at the Yankee Stadium might bring in nearly a hundred thousand dollars at the gate .And while less than ten years earlier the wayward Black Sox -- all of them top performers in their positions -- had toiled for stingy Charles Comiskey at salaries ranging from twenty-five hundred dollars to forty-five hundred dollars a year , stars now were asking ten thousand dollars , twenty thousand dollars , yes , even fifty thousand dollars a season .The greatest team of this period was unquestionably the New York Yankees , bought by brewery millions and made into a ball club by men named Ed Barrow and Miller Huggins .Boston fans sometimes liked to wring some wry satisfaction out of the fact that most of the great 1923-27 crew were graduates of the Red Sox -- sold to millionaires Huston and Ruppert by a man who could not deny them their most trifling desire .Ruth himself , still owning his farm in Massachusetts and an interest in the Massachusetts cigar business that printed his round boyish face on the wrappers , had led the parade down from Fenway Park , followed by pitchers Carl Mays , Leslie `` Joe '' Bush , Waite Hoyt , Herb Pennock , and Sam Jones , catcher Wally Schang , third baseman Joe Dugan ( who completed the `` playboy trio '' of Ruth , Dugan , and Hoyt ) , and shortstop Everett Scott .By 1926 , when the mighty Yanks were at their mightiest , only a few of these were left but they still shone brightest , even beside able and agile rookies like Tony Lazzeri ( who managed never to have one of his epileptic fits on the field ) , Mark Koenig , Lou Gehrig , George Pipgras , and gray-thatched Earl Combs .The deeds of this team , through two seasons and in the two World's Series that followed , have been written and talked about until hardly a word is left to be said .But there is one small episode that a few New York fans who happened to sit in the cheap seats for one World's Series game in 1926 like best to recall .Babe Ruth , as he always did in the Stadium , played right field to avoid having the sun in his eyes , and Tommy Thevenow , a rather mediocre hitter who played shortstop for the St. Louis Cardinals , knocked a ball with all his might into the sharp angle formed by the permanent stands and the wooden bleachers , where Ruth could not reach it .The ball lay there , shining white on the grass in view of nearly every fan in the park while Ruth , red-necked with frustration , charged about the small patch of ground screaming , `` Where's the -- -ing ball '' ? ?But , as he snarled unhappily when the inning was over , `` not a sonofabitch in the place would tell me '' , so little Tommy ran all the way home .The ordinary man and woman , however , saw little of the great professional games of those Golden Days , or of any other sporting event for that matter .Promoters always hastened to place their choice tickets in the hands of the wealthy speculators , and only the man who knew the man who knew the fellow who had an in with the guy at the box office ever came up with a good seat for a contest of any importance .Radio broadcasts , however -- now that even plain people could afford `` loud speakers '' on their sets -- held old fans to the major-league races and attracted new ones , chiefly women , who through what the philosopher called the ineluctable modality of audition , became first inured , then attracted , then addicted to the long afternoon recitals of the doings in some distant baseball park .In some cities games were broadcast throughout the week and then on weekends the announcer was silenced , and fans must needs drive to the city from all the broadcast area to discover how their heroes were faring .This had a pleasant effect upon the Sunday gate receipts as well as upon the intake of the rail and bus companies , some of which began to offer special excursion rates , including seats at the park , just as the trolley and ferry companies had when baseball was new .While women had always attended ball games in small numbers ( it was the part of a `` dead game sport '' in the early years of the twentieth century to be taken out to the ball park and to root , root , root for the home team ) , they had often sat in patient martyrdom , unable even to read the scoreboard , which sometimes seemed to indicate that one team led another by a score of three hundred and eighty to one hundred and fifty-one .The questions women asked at baseball games were standard grist for amateur comedy , as were the doings of women automobile drivers ; ;for every grown man ( except a few who were always suspected of being shy on virility ) knew at least the fundamentals of baseball , just as every male American in this era liked to imagine ( or pretend ) that he could fight with his fists .And women were not expected to know that the pitcher was trying not to let the batter hit the ball .Radio , however , so increased the interest of women in the game that it was hardly necessary even to have `` Ladies' Days '' any longer to enable men to get to the ball park without interference at home .Women actually began to appear unaccompanied in the stands , where they still occasionally ran the risk of coming home with a tobacco-juice stain on a clean skirt or a new curse word tingling their ears .The radio broadcasts themselves were often so patiently informative , despite the baseball jargon , that girls and women could begin to store up in their minds the same sort of random and meaningless statistics that small boys had long learned better than they ever did their lessons in school .The following items may be specified in actual or symbolic form in the operands of those instructions which refer to the particular items : channel , unit , combined channel and unit , combined arm and file , unit record synchronizers , inquiry synchronizers , and alteration switches .The declarative operation EQU is used to equate symbolic names to item numbers ( see page 85 ) .Continuation cardsCertain Autocoder statements make provision for more parameters than may be contained in the operand ( columns 21 - 75 ) of a single line on the Autocoder coding sheet .When this is the case , the appropriate section of this manual will indicate that `` Continuation Cards '' may be used .Thus , when specifically permitted , the operand of a given line on the Autocoder coding sheet may be continued in the operand of from one to four additional lines which immediately follow .The label and operation columns must be blank and the continuation of the operand must begin in column 21 ; ;i.e. , it must be left-justified in the operand column of the coding sheet .The operand need not extend across the entire operand column of either the header card or continuation cards but may end with the comma following any parameter .Remarks may appear to the right of the last parameter on each card provided they are separated from the operand by at least two blank spaces .Illustrations of the use of continuation cards are included throughout the examples illustrating the various statements .If a continuation card follows a statement that does not permit continuation cards , the compiler will generate a NOP and issue an error message .Additional restrictions regarding the use of continuation cards with macro-instructions appear on page 106 .Reservation of index words and electronic switchesThe assignment of actual addresses to symbolic index word and electronic switch names occurs in Phase 3 , of the Autocoder processor .The initial availability of index words and electronic switches is determined by a table which is included in the Compiler Systems Tape .This table originally indicates that index words 1 through 96 and electronic switches 1 through 30 are available for assignment to symbolic references ; ;index words 97 through 99 are not available .The initial setting of this table may be altered , however , as described in the 7070 Data Processing System Bulletin `` IBM 7070 Compiler System : Operating Procedure '' , form Aj .During the first pass of Phase 3 , , references to the actual addresses of index words and electronic switches are collected and the availability table is updated .At the end of this pass , the table indicates which index words and electronic switches are not available for assignment to symbolic references .Both index words and electronic switches may have been made unavailable before the start of assignment in one of the following ways .1 .The initial setting of the availability table indicated that the index word or electronic switch was not available for assignment .2 .The one- or two-digit number of the index word or electronic switch was used in the operand of a symbolic machine instruction to specify indexing or as a parameter which is always an index word or electronic switch , e.g. , 3 .The one- or two-digit number of the index word or electronic switch was used in the operand of an EQU statement , e.g. ,When the index words or electronic switches are reserved because of actual usage in the statements described above , the position or order of the statements within the program is not important ; ;any such reference will make the index word or electronic switch unavailable at the end of this pass .During the assignment pass of Phase 3 , , index words and electronic switches are reserved as they are encountered during assignment .Index words and electronic switches may be reserved in the following ways .The first two methods apply to both index words and electronic switches ; ;the third applies only to index words .1 .During the assignment pass , each instruction is examined for reference to the symbolic name of an index word or electronic switch .When such a reference is found , an actual address is assigned and the availability table is changed so that the assigned index word or switch is no longer available for later assignment .2 .If the one- or two-digit address of an index word or electronic switch is used or is included in the operand of an XRESERVE or SRESERVE statement ( see page 99 ) , the corresponding index word or electronic switch is reserved .3 .If a statement has been assigned an address in the index word areaby means of an actual label orby means of an origin statement which refers to an actual address , the corresponding index word will be reserved .These entries should normally appear at the beginning of the program or immediately following each LITORIGIN statement .Otherwise , symbolic names may have previously been assigned to these same index words .( This method does not apply to electronic switches .)The preceding methods allow efficient use of index words and electronic switches during a sectionalized or multi-phase program , particularly when used in conjunction with the LITORIGIN statement .Extreme caution should be used , however , to avoid the conflicting usage of an index word or electronic switch which may result from the assignment of more than one name or function to the same address .If the symbolic name or actual address of an index word or electronic switch appears or is included in the operand of an XRELEASE or SRELEASE statement ( see page 101 ) , the specified index word or electronic switch will again be made available , regardless of the method by which it was reserved .It will not , however , be used for symbolic assignment until all other index words or electronic switches have been assigned for the first time .If , at any time during the assignment pass , the compiler finds that there are no more index words available for assignment , the warning message `` No More Index Words Available '' will be placed in the object program listing , the table will be altered to show that index words 1 through 96 are available , and the assignment will continue as before .If the compiler finds that there are no more electronic switches available for assignment , the warning message `` No More Electronic Switches Available '' will be placed in the object program listing , the table will be altered to show that electronic switches 1 through 30 are available , and assignment will continue as before .The resultant conflicting usage of index words or electronic switches may be avoided by reducing the number of symbolic names used , e.g. , through the proper use of the EQU , XRELEASE , or SRELEASE statements .As noted in Appendix C , index words 97 through 99 are never available for assignment to symbolic names by the compiler ; ;also , index words 93 through 96 may have been made unavailable for assignment .Declarative statementsAutocoder declarative statements provide the processor with the necessary information to complete the imperative operations properly .Declarative statements are never executed in the object program and should be separated from the program instruction area , placed preferably at its beginning or end .Otherwise , special care must be taken to branch around them so that the program will not attempt to execute something in a data area as an instruction .If the compiler does encounter such statements , a warning message will be issued .7070 Autocoder includes the following declarative statements : DA ( Define Area ) , DC ( Define Constant ) , DRDW ( Define Record Definition Word ) , DSW ( Define Switch ) , DLINE ( Define Line ) , EQU ( Equate ) , CODE,DTF ( Define Tape File ) , DIOCS ( Define Input Control System ) , and DUF ( Descriptive Entry For Unit Records ) .DA , DC , DTF , and DLINE require more than one entry .The DA statement is used to name and define the positions and length of fields within an area .The DC statement is used to name and enter constants into the object program .Since the 7070 and 7074 make use of record definition words ( RDWS ) to read , write , move , and otherwise examine blocks of storage , the DA and DC statements provide the option of generating RDWS automatically .When so instructed , Autocoder will generate one or more RDWS and assign them successive locations immediately preceding the area with which they are to be associated .An RDW will be of the form Af , where xxxx is the starting location of the area and yyyy is its ending location .These addresses are calculated automatically by the processor .In some cases , it may be more advantageous to assign locations to RDWS associated with DA and DC areas in some other part of storage , i.e. , not immediately preceding the DA or DC areas .The DRDW statement may be used for this purpose .The DRDW statement may also be used to generate an RDW defining any area specified by the programmer .As many as ten digital switches may be named and provided by the DSW statement for consideration by the SETSW and logic macro-instructions .Each switch occupies one digit position in a word , can be set on or off , and is considered as logically equivalent to an electronic switch .It cannot , however , be referred to by electronic switch commands , e.g. , ESN , BSN , etc. .An individual switch or the entire set of switches in a word may be tested or altered as desired .Through use of the DLINE statement , a means is provided for specifying both the editing of fields to be inserted in a print line area and the layout of the area itself .The area may include constant information supplied by the programmer .The area may also be provided with additional data during the running of the object program by means of EDMOV or move macro-instructions .The declarative statement EQU permits the programmer to equate symbolic names to actual index words , electronic switches , arm and file numbers , tape channel and unit numbers , alteration switches , etc. , and to equate a symbol to another symbol or to an actual address .The DIOCS , DTF , and DUF statements are used when required by the Input Control System .DIOCS is used to select the major methods of processing to be used , and to name the index words used by Aj .Each tape file must be described by Tape File Specifications , produced by Aj .In addition to information related to the file and its records , the File Specifications contain subroutine locations and the location of tape label information .A DUF entry must be supplied for every unit record file describing the type of file and the unit record equipment to be used .The DUF also supplies the locations of subroutines written by the user that are unique to the file .A full description of the DIOCS , DTF , and DUF statements is contained in the 7070 Data Processing System Bulletin `` IBM 7070 Input Control System '' , form Aj .Brief descriptions of these three declarative statements and detailed descriptions of the formats and functions of each of the other 7070 Autocoder declarative statements follow below .diocs -- define input control systemWhen the Input Control System is to be used in a program , a DIOCS statement must be used to select the major methods of processing to be used .This statement also allows the naming of the index words used by Aj .Source program formatThe basic format of the DIOCS statement is as follows : anylabel is any symbolic label ; ;it may be omitted .The entry DIOCS must be written exactly as shown .The first item in the operand , IOCSIXF , is used to specify the first IOCS index word for programs using tape files .This item may be a symbolic name or an actual one-digit or two-digit index word address in the range 3 - 94 .If the first item in the operand is omitted , the symbolic name IOCSIXF will be assigned .When an actual index word or a symbolic address is specified , Autocoder will equate the name IOCSIXF to it .The second item in the operand , IOCSIXG , is used to specify the second IOCS index word for programs using tape files .This item may be a symbolic name or an actual one-digit or two-digit index word address in the range 3 - 94 .If the second item in the operand is omitted , the symbolic name IOCSIXG will be assigned .When an actual index word or a symbolic address is specified , Autocoder will equate IOCSIXG to it .One hundred years ago there existed in England the Association for the Promotion of the Unity of Christendom .Representing as it did the efforts of only unauthorized individuals of the Roman and Anglican Churches , and urging a communion of prayer unacceptable to Rome , this association produced little fruit , and , in fact , was condemned by the Holy Office in 1864 .Now again in 1961 , in England , there is perhaps nothing in the religious sphere so popularly discussed as Christian unity .The Church Unity Octave , January 18-25 , was enthusiastically devoted to prayer and discussion by the various churches .Many people seem hopeful , yet it is difficult to predict whether or not there will be any more real attainment of Christian unity in 1961 than there was in 1861 .But it must be readily seen that the religious picture in England has so greatly changed during these hundred years as to engender hope , at least on the Catholic side .For the `` tide is well on the turn '' , as the London Catholic weekly Universe has written .I came to England last summer to do research on the unpublished letters of Cardinal Newman .As an American Catholic of Irish ancestry , I came with certain preconceptions and expectations ; ;being intellectually influenced by Newman and the general 19th-century literature of England , I knew only a Protestant-dominated country .Since arriving here , however , I have formed a far different religious picture of present-day England .In representing part of this new picture , I will be recounting some of my own personal experiences , reactions and judgments ; ;but my primary aim is to transcribe what Englishmen themselves are saying and writing and implying about the Roman and Anglican Churches and about the present religious state of England .Since the Protestant clergy for the most part wear gray or some variant from the wholly black suit , my Roman collar and black garb usually identify me in England as a Roman Catholic cleric .In any case , I have always been treated with the utmost courtesy by Englishmen , even in Devonshire and Cornwall , where anti-Catholic feeling has supposedly existed the strongest and longest .Nowhere have I seen public expression of anti-Catholicism .On my first Guy Fawkes Day here , I found Catholics as well as non-Catholics celebrating with the traditional fireworks and bonfires , and was told that most Englishmen either do not know or are not concerned with the historical significance of the day .A Birmingham newspaper printed in a column for children an article entitled `` The True Story of Guy Fawkes '' , which began :`` When you pile your `` guy '' on the bonfire tomorrow night , I wonder how much of the true story of Guy Fawkes you will remember ? ?In the 355 years since the first Guy Fawkes Night , much of the story has been forgotten , so here is a reminder '' .The article proceeded to give an inaccurate account of a Catholic plot to kill King James 1 .In spite of the increase in numbers and prestige brought about by the conversions of Newman and other Tractarians of the 1840's and 1850's , the Catholic segment of England one hundred years ago was a very small one ( four per cent , or 800,000 ) which did not enjoy a gracious hearing from the general public .The return of the Catholic hierarchy in 1850 was looked upon with indignant disapprobation and , in fact , was charged with being a gesture of disloyalty .In 1864 Newman professedly had to write his Apologia with his keenest feelings in order to be believed and to command a fair hearing from English readers .Now , in 1961 , the Catholic population of England is still quite small ( ten per cent , or 5 million ) ; ;yet it represents a very considerable percentage of the churchgoing population .A Protestant woman marveled to me over the large crowds going in and out of the Birmingham Oratory ( Catholic ) Church on Sunday mornings .She found this a marvel because , as she said , only six per cent of English people are churchgoers .She may not have been exact on this number , but others here feel quite certain that the percentage would be less than ten .From many sides come remarks that Protestant churches are badly attended and the large medieval cathedrals look all but empty during services .A Catholic priest recently recounted how in the chapel of a large city university , following Anglican evensong , at which there was a congregation of twelve , he celebrated Mass before more than a hundred .The Protestant themselves are the first to admit the great falling off in effective membership in their churches .According to a newspaper report of the 1961 statistics of the Church of England , the `` total of confirmed members is 9,748,000 , but only 2,887,671 are registered on the parochial church rolls '' , and `` over 27 million people in England are baptized into the Church of England , but roughly only a tenth of them continue '' .An amazing article in the Manchester Guardian of last November , entitled `` Fate Of Redundant Churches '' , states than an Archbishops' Commission `` reported last month that in the Church of England alone there are 790 churches which are redundant now , or will be in 20 years' time .A further 260 Anglican churches have been demolished since 1948 '' .And in the last five years , the `` Methodist chapel committee has authorized the demolition or , more often , the sale of 764 chapels '' .Most of these former churches are now used as warehouses , but `` neither Anglicans nor Nonconformists object to selling churches to Roman Catholics '' , and have done so .While it must be said that these same Protestants have built some new churches during this period , and that religious population shifts have emptied churches , a principal reason for this phenomenon of redundancy is that fewer Protestants are going to church .It should be admitted , too , that there is a good percentage of lapsed or nonchurchgoing Catholics ( one paper writes 50 per cent ) .Still , it is clear from such reports , and apparently clear from the remarks of many people , that Protestants are decreasing and Catholics increasing .An Anglican clergyman in Oxford sadly but frankly acknowledged to me that this is true .A century ago , Newman saw that liberalism ( what we now might call secularism ) would gradually but definitely make its mark on English Protestantism , and that even high Anglicanism would someday no longer be a `` serviceable breakwater against doctrinal errors more fundamental than its own '' .That day is perhaps today , 1961 , and it seems no longer very meaningful to call England a `` Protestant country '' .One of the ironies of the present crusade for Christian unity is that there are not , relatively speaking , many real Christians to unite .Many English Catholics are proud of their Catholicism and know that they are in a new ascendancy .The London Universe devoted its centenary issue last December 8 to mapping out various aspects of Catholic progress during the last one hundred years .With traditional nationalistic spirit , some Englishmen claim that English Catholicism is Catholicism at its best .I have found myself saying with other foreigners here that English Catholics are good Catholics .It has been my experience to find as many men as women in church , and to hear almost everyone in church congregations reciting the Latin prayers and responses at Mass .They hope , of course , to reclaim the non-Catholic population to the Catholic faith , and at every Sunday Benediction they recite by heart the `` Prayer for England '' :`` O Blessed Virgin Mary , Mother of God and our most gentle queen and mother , look down in mercy upon England , thy `` dowry '' , and upon us all who greatly hope and trust in thee .Intercede for our separated brethren , that with us in the one true fold they may be united to the chief Shepherd , the vicar of thy Son .'' A hymn often to be heard in Catholic churches is `` Faith Of Our Fathers '' , which glories in England's ancient faith that endured persecution , and which proclaims : `` Faith of our Fathers : Mary's prayers Shall win our country back to thee '' .The English saints are widely venerated , quite naturally , and now there is great hope that the Forty Martyrs and Cardinal Newman will soon be canonized .
